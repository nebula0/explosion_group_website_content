 Aims: Our aim is to provide an observational view of the old Disk structure
of the Milky Way galaxy using the distribution of red clump stars. The spiral
arms, warp structure, and other asymmetries present in the Disk are re-visited
using a systematic study of red clump star counts over the disk of the Galaxy.
  Methods: We developed a method to systematically extract the red clump stars
from 2MASS ($J-K_s, ~J$) colour-magnitude diagram of $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$
bins in $\ell \times b$ covering the range $40^\circ \le \ell \le 320^\circ$
and $-10^\circ \le b \le 10^\circ$. 2MASS data continues to be important since
it is able to identify and trace the red clump stars to much farther distances
than any optical survey of the Disk. The foreground star contamination in the
selected sample is removed by utilising the accurate astrometric data from Gaia
EDR3 and astrophysical parameters from Gaia DR3.
  Results: We have generated a face-on-view (XY-plane) of the Galaxy depicting
the density distribution and count ratio above and below the Galactic plane.
The resulting overdensity of red clump stars traces the continuous morphology
of the Outer arm from the second to the third Galactic quadrant. This is the
first study to map the Outer arms across the disk using red clump stars.
Through this study, we are able to trace the Outer arm well into the 3rd
Galactic quadrant for the first time. Apart from the spiral structures, we also
see a wave-like asymmetry above and below the Galactic plane with respect to
longitudes, indicating a warp structure. The warp structure is studied
systematically by tracing the ratio of red clump stars above and below the
Galactic plane. We provide the first direct observational evidence of the
asymmetry in the Outer spiral arms confirming that the spiral arms traced by
the older population are also warped similar to the Disk.
