 Polar dust has been found to play an important role in the mid-infrared
emission of nearby Seyfert nuclei. If and how often polar dust exists among the
quasar population is unknown due to the lack of spatially-resolved
observations. In this Letter, we report correlations between the prominence of
AGN forbidden line emission (commonly associated with the narrow line region)
and the dust mid-IR energy output among the archetypal Palomar-Green quasar
sample and other bright type-1 AGNs drawn from the SDSS, Spitzer and WISE
archives. The AGN mid-IR color differences traced by WISE W2 ($\sim4.6 \mu
m$)$-$W3 ($\sim12 \mu m$) and W2 ($\sim4.6 \mu m$)$-$W4 ($\sim22 \mu m$), and
near-IR to mid-IR SEDs constrained with 2MASS, WISE and Spitzer data have clear
trends with the relative strength of the forbidden line regions traced by the
optical \OIII and mid-IR \OIV emission lines. These observations indicate that,
where the lines are strong, a large fraction of the AGN emission at
$\lambda\gtrsim5 \mu$m comes from dust in the forbidden line regions. We find
that the widely quoted universal AGN template is a result of averaging quasar
SEDs with different levels of polar dust emission above the torus output and
that the typical intrinsic IR SED of compact torus dust emission alone falls
with increasing wavelength past 5 $\mu$m (in $\nu F_\nu$). In addition, the
association of polar dust with the forbidden lines suggests an alternative to
the receding torus hypothesis for the decrease in infrared output with
increasing AGN luminosity.
