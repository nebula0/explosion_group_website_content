 We perform a search for galaxy-galaxy strong lens systems using a
convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to imaging data from the first
public data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey (DELVE), which
contains $\sim 520$ million astronomical sources covering $\sim 4,000$
$\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the southern sky to a $5\sigma$ point-source depth of
$g=24.3$, $r=23.9$, $i=23.3$, and $z=22.8$ mag. Following the methodology of
similar searches using DECam data, we select a catalog of $\sim 11$ million
extended astronomical sources with $16 < g < 22$, $17.2 < r < 22$, $15 < i <
21$, $0 < g - i < 3$, and $-0.2 < g - r < 1.75$. After scoring with our CNN,
the highest scoring 50,000 images were visually inspected and assigned a score
on a scale from 0 (definitely not a lens) to 3 (very probable lens). We present
a list of 617 strong lens candidates, 599 of which are previously unreported.
We additionally highlight 8 potential quadruply lensed quasars from this
sample. Due to the location of our search footprint in the northern Galactic
cap ($b > 10$ deg) and southern celestial hemisphere (${\rm Dec.}<0$ deg), our
candidate list has little overlap with other existing ground-based searches.
Where our search footprint does overlap with other searches, we find a
significant number of high-quality candidates which were previously
unidentified, indicating a degree of orthogonality in our methodology. We
categorize our candidates using their human-assigned scores and report
properties including apparent magnitude and Einstein radius estimated from the
image separation.
