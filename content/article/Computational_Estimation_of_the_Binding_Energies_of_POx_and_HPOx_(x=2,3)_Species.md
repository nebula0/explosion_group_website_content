 The distribution of molecules between the gas and solid phase during star and
planet formation, determines the trajectory of gas and grain surface chemistry,
as well as the delivery of elements to nascent planets. This distribution is
primarily set by the binding energies of different molecules to water ice
surfaces. We computationally estimated the binding energies of ten
astrochemically relevant P-bearing species on water surface, we also validate
our method for 20 species with known binding energies. We used DFT calculations
(M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ) to calculate the energetics of molecules and
water-molecule clusters (1-3 H$_2$O molecules) and from this determined the
binding energy by comparing the complex and the separate molecule and cluster
energies. We also explore whether these estimates can be improved by first
calibrating our computational method using experimentally measured binding
energies. Using the 20 reference molecules we find that the 2H$_2$O cluster
size yields the best binding energy estimates and that the application of a
calibration to the data may improve the results for some classes of molecules,
including more refractory species. Based on these calculations we find that,
small P-bearing molecules such as PH$_3$, PN, PO, HPO, PO$_2$ and POOH are
relatively volatile and should desorb prior or concomitantly with water ice,
while H$_2$PO, HPO$_2$, PO$_3$, PO$_2$OH can strongly bind to any hydroxylated
surface, and will likely remain on the interstellar grains surface past the
desorbtion of water ice. The depletion of P-carriers on grains constitute a
pathway for the inclusion of Phosphorous molecules in planets and
planetesimals.
