 The volcanism plays an important part in mass exchange circle to bring matter
from core of planet to atmosphere. Thus, it is a possible method to research
the change of elements abundance in atmosphere by modeling the process of
volatiles from volcanism get through and mix in atmosphere, which is the
focused point of this article. This article penetrates from the generation of
volatiles, talks the species, mass, and mole fractions of different typical
elements in magma. Then a diffusion progress model of volatiles was built to
quantify the abundance of elements with altitude. And the quantitative models
of element abundance at different heights are obtained.
