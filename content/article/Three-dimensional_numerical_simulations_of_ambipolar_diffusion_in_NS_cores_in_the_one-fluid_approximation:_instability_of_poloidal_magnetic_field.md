 We numerically model evolution of magnetic fields inside a neutron star under
the influence of ambipolar diffusion in the weak-coupling mode in the one-fluid
MHD approximation. Our simulations are three-dimensional and performed in
spherical coordinates. Our model covers the neutron star core and includes
crust where the magnetic field decay is due to Ohmic decay. We discover an
instability of poloidal magnetic field under the influence of ambipolar
diffusion. This instability develops in the neutron star core and grows on a
timescale of 0.2 dimensionless times, reaching saturation by 2 dimensionless
times. The instability leads to formation of azimuthal magnetic field with
azimuthal wavenumber $m=14$ (at the moment of saturation) which keeps merging
and reaches $m=4$ by 16 dimensionless times. Over the course of our simulations
(16 dimensionless times) the surface dipolar magnetic field decays, reaching 20
percent of its original value and keeps decaying. The decay timescale for the
total magnetic energy is six dimensionless times. The ambipolar diffusion
induces electric currents in the crust where these currents dissipate
efficiently. Strong electric currents in the crust lead to heating, which could
correspond to luminosities of $\approx 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ during hundreds of
Myrs for an initial magnetic field of $10^{14}$ G. Ambipolar diffusion leads to
formation of small-scale magnetic fields at the neutron star surface.
