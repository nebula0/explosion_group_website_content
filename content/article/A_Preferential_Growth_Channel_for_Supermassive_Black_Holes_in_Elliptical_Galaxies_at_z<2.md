 The assembly of stellar and supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in elliptical
galaxies since $z\sim1$ can help to diagnose the origins of locally-observed
correlations between SMBH mass and stellar mass. We therefore construct three
samples of elliptical galaxies, one at $z\sim0$ and two at $0.7\lesssim z
\lesssim2.5$, and quantify their relative positions in the $M_{BH}-M_*$ plane.
Using a Bayesian analysis framework, we find evidence for translational offsets
in both stellar mass and SMBH mass between the local sample and both higher
redshift samples. The offsets in stellar mass are small, and consistent with
measurement bias, but the offsets in SMBH mass are much larger, reaching a
factor of seven between $z\sim1$ and $z\sim0$. The magnitude of the SMBH offset
may also depend on redshift, reaching a factor of $\sim20$ at $z\sim 2$. The
result is robust against variation in the high and low redshift samples and
changes in the analysis approach. The magnitude and redshift evolution of the
offset are challenging to explain in terms of selection and measurement biases.
We conclude that either there is a physical mechanism that preferentially grows
SMBHs in elliptical galaxies at $z\lesssim 2$, or that selection and
measurement biases are both underestimated, and depend on redshift.
