 We examine the HI gas kinematics of galaxy pairs in two clusters and a group
using Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) WALLABY pilot survey
observations. We compare the HI properties of galaxy pair candidates in the
Hydra I and Norma clusters, and the NGC 4636 group, with those of non-paired
control galaxies selected in the same fields. We perform HI profile
decomposition of the sample galaxies using a tool, {\sc baygaud} which allows
us to de-blend a line-of-sight velocity profile with an optimal number of
Gaussian components. We construct HI super-profiles of the sample galaxies via
stacking of their line profiles after aligning the central velocities. We fit a
double Gaussian model to the super-profiles and classify them as kinematically
narrow and broad components with respect to their velocity dispersions.
Additionally, we investigate the gravitational instability of HI gas disks of
the sample galaxies using Toomre Q parameters and HI morphological
disturbances. We investigate the effect of the cluster environment on the HI
properties of galaxy pairs by dividing the cluster environment into three
subcluster regions (i.e., outskirts, infalling and central regions). We find
that the denser cluster environment (i.e., infalling and central regions) is
likely to impact the HI gas properties of galaxies in a way of decreasing the
amplitude of the kinematically narrow HI gas
($M_{\rm{narrow}}^{\rm{HI}}$/$M_{\rm{total}}^{\rm{HI}}$), and increasing the
Toomre Q values of the infalling and central galaxies. This tendency is likely
to be more enhanced for galaxy pairs in the cluster environment.
