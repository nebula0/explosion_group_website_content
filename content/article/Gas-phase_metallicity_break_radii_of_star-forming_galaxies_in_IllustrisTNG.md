 We present radial gas-phase metallicity profiles, gradients, and break radii
at redshift $z = 0 - 3$ from the TNG50-1 star-forming galaxy population. These
metallicity profiles are characterized by an emphasis on identifying the steep
inner gradient and flat outer gradient. From this, the break radius, $r_{\rm
Break}$, is defined as the region where the transition occurs. We observe the
break radius having a positive trend with mass that weakens with redshift. When
normalized by the stellar half-mass radius, the break radius has a weaker
relation with both mass and redshift. To test if our results are dependent on
the resolution or adopted physics of TNG50-1, the same analysis is performed in
TNG50-2 and Illustris-1. We find general agreement between each of the
simulations in their qualitative trends; however, the adopted physics between
TNG and Illustris differ and therefore the breaks, normalized by galaxy size,
deviate by a factor of $\sim$2. In order to understand where the break comes
from, we define two relevant time-scales: an enrichment time-scale and a radial
gas mixing time-scale. We find that $r_{\rm Break}$ occurs where the gas mixing
time-scale is $\sim$10 times as long as the enrichment time-scale in all three
simulation runs, with some weak mass and redshift dependence. This implies that
galactic disks can be thought of in two-parts: a star-forming inner disk with a
steep gradient and a mixing-dominated outer disk with a flat gradient, with the
break radius marking the region of transition between them.
