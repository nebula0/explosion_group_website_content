 Solar active regions (ARs) play a fundamental role in driving many of the
geo-effective eruptions which propagate into the Solar System. However, we are
still unable to consistently predict where and when ARs will occur across the
solar disk by identifying pre-emergence signatures in observables such as the
Doppler velocity (without using Helioseismic methods). Here we aim to determine
the earliest time at which pre-emergence signatures, specifically the
Horizontal Divergent Flow (HDF), can be confidently detected using data from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI).
Initially, we follow previous studies using the thresholding method, which
searches for significant increases in the number of pixels that display a
specific line-of-sight velocity. We expand this method to more velocity windows
and conduct a basic parameter study investigating the effect of cadence on the
inferred results. Our findings agree with previous studies with $37.5$% of ARs
displaying a HDF, with average lead times between the HDF and flux emergence of
$58$ minutes. We present a new potential signature of flux emergence which
manifests as cadence-independent transient disruptions to the amplitudes of
multiple velocity windows and recover potential pre-emergence signatures for 10
of the 16 ARs studied, with lead times of 60-156 minutes. Several effects can
influence both the estimated times of both HDF and flux emergence suggesting
that one may need to combine Doppler and magnetic field data to get a reliable
indicator of continued flux emergence.
