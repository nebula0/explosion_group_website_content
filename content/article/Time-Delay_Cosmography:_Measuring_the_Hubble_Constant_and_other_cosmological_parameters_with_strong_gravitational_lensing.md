 Multiply lensed sources experience a relative time delay in the arrival of
photons. This effect can be used to measure absolute distances and the Hubble
constant ($H_0$) and is known as time-delay cosmography. The methodology is
independent of the local distance ladder and early-universe physics and
provides a precise and competitive measurement of $H_0$. With upcoming
observatories, time-delay cosmography can provide a 1% precision measurement of
$H_0$ and can decisively shed light on the current reported 'Hubble tension'.
This paper presents the theoretical background and the current techniques
applied for time-delay cosmographic studies and the measurement of the Hubble
constant. The paper describes the challenges and systematics in the different
components of the analysis and strategies to mitigate them. The current
measurements are discussed in context and the opportunities with the
anticipated data sets in the future are laid out.
