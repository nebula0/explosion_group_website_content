 We examine in greater detail five events previously identified as being
sources of strong transient coronal outflows in a solar polar region in
Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) Doppler data. Although relatively compact
or faint and inconspicuous in Hinode/Soft X-ray Telescope (XRT) soft-X-ray
(SXR) images and in Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) EUV images, we find that all of these events are consistent with
being faint coronal X-ray jets. The evidence for this is that the events result
from eruption of minifilaments of projected sizes spanning 5000 -- 14,000 km
and with erupting velocities spanning 19 -- 46 km/s, which are in the range of
values observed in cases of confirmed X-ray polar coronal hole jets. In SXR
images, and in some EUV images, all five events show base brightenings, and
faint indications of a jet spire that (in four of five cases where
determinable) moves away from the brightest base brightening; these properties
are common to more obvious X-ray jets. For a comparatively low-latitude event,
the minifilament erupts from near (<~few arcsec) a location of
near-eruption-time opposite-polarity magnetic-flux-patch convergence, which
again is consistent with many observed coronal jets. Thus, although too faint
to be identified as jets a priori, otherwise all five events are identical to
typical coronal jets. This suggests that jets may be more numerous than
recognized in previous studies, and might contribute substantially to solar
wind outflow, and to the population of magnetic switchbacks observed in Parker
Solar Probe (PSP) data.
