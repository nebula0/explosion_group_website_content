 Observations of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems have
enabled unique tests of nonlinear departures from general relativity (GR) on
the galactic and supergalactic scales. One of the most important cases of such
tests is constraints on the gravitational slip between two scalar gravitational
potentials. In this paper, we use a newly compiled sample of strong
gravitational lenses to test the validity of GR, focusing on the screening
effects on the apparent positions of lensed sources relative to the GR
predictions. This is the first simultaneous measurement of the Post-Newtonian
(PN) parameter ($\gamma_{PN}$) and the screening radius ($\Lambda$) without any
assumptions about the contents of the Universe. Our results suggest that the
measured PPN is marginally consistent with GR ($\gamma_{PN}=1$) with increasing
screening radius ($\Lambda = 10-300 $kpc), although the choice of lens models
may have a significant influence on the final measurements. Based on a
well-defined sample of 5000 simulated strong lenses from the forthcoming LSST,
our methodology will provide a strong extragalactic test of GR with an accuracy
of 0.5\%, assessed up to scales of $\Lambda \sim 300$ kpc. For the current and
future observations of available SGL systems, there is no noticeable evidence
indicating some specific cutoff scales on kpc-Mpc scales, beyond which new
gravitational degrees of freedom are expressed.
