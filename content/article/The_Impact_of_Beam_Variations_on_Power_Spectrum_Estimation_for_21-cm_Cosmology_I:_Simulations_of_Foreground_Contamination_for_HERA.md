 Detecting cosmological signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) requires
high-precision calibration to isolate the cosmological signals from foreground
emission. In radio interferometery, perturbed primary beams of antenna elements
can disrupt the precise calibration, which results in contaminating the
foreground-free region, or the EoR window, in the cylindrically averaged power
spectrum. For Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), we simulate and
characterize the perturbed primary beams induced by feed motions such as axial,
lateral, and tilting motions, above the 14-meter dish. To understand the effect
of the perturbed beams, visibility measurements are modeled with two different
foreground components, point sources and diffuse sources, and we find different
feed motions present a different reaction to each type of sky source. HERA's
redundant-baseline calibration in the presence of non-redundant antenna beams
due to feed motions introduces chromatic errors in gain solutions, which
produces foreground power leakage into the EoR window. The observed leakage
from vertical feed motions comes predominately from point sources around
zenith. Furthermore, the observed leakage from horizontal and tilting feed
motion comes predominately from the diffuse components near the horizon.
Mitigation of chromatic gain errors will be necessary for robust detection of
the EoR signals with minimal foreground bias, and this will be discussed in the
subsequent paper.
