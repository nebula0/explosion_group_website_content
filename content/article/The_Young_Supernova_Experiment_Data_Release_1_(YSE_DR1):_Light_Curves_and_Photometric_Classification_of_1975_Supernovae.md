 We present the Young Supernova Experiment Data Release 1 (YSE DR1), comprised
of processed multi-color Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) griz and Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF) gr photometry of 1975 transients with host-galaxy associations,
redshifts, spectroscopic/photometric classifications, and additional data
products from 2019 November 24 to 2021 December 20. YSE DR1 spans discoveries
and observations from young and fast-rising supernovae (SNe) to transients that
persist for over a year, with a redshift distribution reaching z~0.5. We
present relative SN rates from YSE's magnitude- and volume-limited surveys,
which are consistent with previously published values within estimated
uncertainties for untargeted surveys. We combine YSE and ZTF data, and create
multi-survey SN simulations to train the ParSNIP photometric classification
algorithm; when validating our classifier on 472 spectroscopically classified
YSE DR1 SNe, we achieve 82% accuracy across three SN classes (SNe Ia, II,
Ib/Ic) and 90% accuracy across two SN classes (SNe Ia, core-collapse SNe). Our
classifier performs particularly well on SNe Ia, with high (>90%) individual
completeness and purity, which will help build an anchor photometric SNe Ia
sample for cosmology. We then use our photometric classifier to characterize
our photometric sample of 1483 SNe, labeling 1048 (~71%) SNe Ia, 339 (~23%) SNe
II, and 96 (~6%) SNe Ib/Ic. Our approach demonstrates that simulations can be
used to improve the performance of photometric classifiers applied to real
data. YSE DR1 provides a training ground for building discovery, anomaly
detection, and classification algorithms, performing cosmological analyses,
understanding the nature of red and rare transients, exploring tidal disruption
events and nuclear variability, and preparing for the forthcoming Vera C. Rubin
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
