 Built in 2004, the Skynet robotic telescope network originally consisted of
six 0.4 m telescopes located at the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory in
the Chilean Andes. The network was designed to carry out simultaneous
multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) when they are only
tens of seconds old. To date, the network has been expanded to ~20 telescopes,
including a 20 m radio telescope, that span four continents and five countries.
The Campaign Manager (CM) is a new observing mode that has been developed for
Skynet. Available to all Skynet observers, the CM semi-autonomously and
indefinitely scales and schedules exposures on the observer's behalf while
allowing for modification to scaling parameters in real time. The CM is useful
for follow up to various transient phenomena including gravitational-wave
events, GRB localizations, young supernovae, and eventually, sufficiently
bright Argus Optical Array and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope events.
