 We model the stellar abundances and ages of two disrupted dwarf galaxies in
the Milky Way stellar halo: Gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE) and Wukong/LMS-1.
Using a statistically robust likelihood function, we fit one-zone models of
galactic chemical evolution with exponential infall histories to both systems,
deriving e-folding timescales of $\tau_\text{in} = 1.01 \pm 0.13$ Gyr for GSE
and $\tau_\text{in} = 3.08^{+3.19}_{-1.16}$ Gyr for Wukong/LMS-1. GSE formed
stars for $\tau_\text{tot} = 5.40^{+0.32}_{-0.31}$ Gyr, sustaining star
formation for $\sim$$1.5 - 2$ Gyr after its first infall into the Milky Way
$\sim$10 Gyr ago. Our fit suggests that star formation lasted for
$\tau_\text{tot} = 3.36^{+0.55}_{-0.47}$ Gyr in Wukong/LMS-1, though our sample
does not contain any age measurements. The differences in evolutionary
parameters between the two are qualitatively consistent with trends with
stellar mass $M_\star$ predicted by simulations and semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation. Our fitting method is based only on poisson sampling from an
evolutionary track and requires no binning of the data. We demonstrate its
accuracy by testing against mock data, showing that it accurately recovers the
input model across a broad range of sample sizes ($20 \leq N \leq 2000$) and
measurement uncertainties ($0.01 \leq \sigma_\text{[$\alpha$/Fe]},
\sigma_\text{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.5$; $0.02 \leq \sigma_{\log_{10}(\text{age})} \leq
1$). Our inferred values of the outflow mass-loading factor reasonably match
$\eta \propto M_\star^{-1/3}$ as predicted by galactic wind models. Due to the
generic nature of our derivation, this likelihood function should be applicable
to one-zone models of any parametrization and easily extensible to other
astrophysical models which predict tracks in some observed space.
