 We present a JWST/MIRI low-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic
observation of the normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2021aefx at +323 days
past rest-frame B-band maximum light. The spectrum ranges from 4-14 um, and
shows many unique qualities including a flat-topped $[Ar III]$ 8.991 um profile,
a strongly tilted $[Co III]$ 11.888 um feature, and multiple stable Ni lines.
These features provide critical information about the physics of the explosion.
The observations are compared to synthetic spectra from detailed NLTE
multi-dimensional models. The results of the best-fitting model are used to
identify the components of the spectral blends and provide a quantitative
comparison to the explosion physics. Emission line profiles and the presence of
electron capture (EC) elements are used to constrain the mass of the exploding
white dwarf (WD) and the chemical asymmetries in the ejecta. We show that the
observations of SN 2021aefx are consistent with an off-center
delayed-detonation explosion of a near-Chandrasekhar mass (Mch) WD at a viewing
angle of -30 degrees relative to the point of the deflagration-to-detonation
transition. From the strength of the stable Ni lines we determine that there is
little to no mixing in the central regions of the ejecta. Based on both the
presence of stable Ni and the Ar velocity distributions, we obtain a strict
lower limit of 1.2 Msun of the initial WD, implying that most sub-Mch
explosions models are not viable models for SN 2021aefx. The analysis here
shows the crucial importance of MIR spectra for distinguishing between
explosion scenarios for SNe Ia.
