 We present maps of the 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
emission feature in NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 as observed with the
Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imager on JWST from the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1
Treasury project. We create maps that isolate the 3.3 micron PAH feature in the
F335M filter (F335M$_{\rm PAH}$) using combinations of the F300M and F360M
filters for removal of starlight continuum. This continuum removal is
complicated by contamination of the F360M by PAH emission and variations in the
stellar spectral energy distribution slopes between 3.0 and 3.6 micron. We
modify the empirical prescription from Lai et al. (2020) to remove the
starlight continuum in our highly resolved galaxies, which have a range of
starlight- and PAH-dominated lines-of-sight. Analyzing radially binned profiles
of the F335M$_{\rm PAH}$ emission, we find that between 5-65% of the F335M
intensity comes from the 3.3 micron feature within the inner 0.5 $r_{25}$ of
our targets. This percentage systematically varies from galaxy to galaxy, and
shows radial trends within the galaxies related to each galaxy's distribution
of stellar mass, interstellar medium, and star formation. The 3.3 micron
emission is well correlated with the 11.3 micron PAH feature traced with the
MIRI F1130W filter, as is expected, since both features arise from C-H
vibrational modes. The average F335M$_{\rm PAH}$/F1130W ratio agrees with the
predictions of recent models by Draine et al. (2021) for PAHs with size and
charge distributions shifted towards larger grains with normal or higher
ionization.
