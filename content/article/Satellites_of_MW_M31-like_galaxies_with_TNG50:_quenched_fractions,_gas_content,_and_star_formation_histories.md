 We analyse the quenched fractions, gas content, and star formation histories
of ~1200 satellite galaxies with M* >= 5x10^6 Msun around 198 Milky Way- (MW)
and Andromeda-like (M31) hosts in TNG50, the highest-resolution run of the
IllustrisTNG simulations. Satellites exhibit larger quenched fractions for
smaller masses, at smaller distances to their host galaxy, and in the more
massive M31-like compared to MW-like hosts. As satellites cross their host's
virial radius, their gas content drops significantly: most satellites within
300 kpc do not contain any detectable gas reservoirs at z=0, unless they are
massive like the Magellanic Clouds and M32. Nevertheless, their stellar
assembly exhibits a large degree of diversity. On average, the cumulative star
formation histories of satellites are more extended for brighter, more massive
satellites with a later infall, and for those in less massive hosts. Based on
these relationships, we can even infer infall periods for observed MW and M31
dwarfs: e.g. 0-4 Gyr ago for the Magellanic Clouds and Leo I, 4-8 and 0-2 Gyr
ago for M32 and IC 10, respectively. Ram pressure stripping (in combination
with tidal stripping) deprives TNG50 satellites of their gas reservoirs and
ultimately quenches their star formation activity, even though only a few per
cent of the present-day satellites around the 198 TNG50 MW/M31-like hosts
appear as jellyfish. The typical time since quenching for currently quenched
TNG50 satellites is 6.9 (+2.5)(-3.3) Gyr ago. The TNG50 results are consistent
with the quenched fractions and stellar assembly of observed MW and M31
satellites, however, satellites of the SAGA survey exhibit lower quenched
fractions than TNG50 and other, observed analogues.
