 In our previous work [Tamburini and Licata (2017)] we discussed the
hypothesis that the ultrafast periodic spectral modulations with frequency $f_S
\simeq 0.61$ THz found by Borra and Trottier (2016) in $236$ main sequence
stars from a sample of $2.5$ million spectra of galactic halo stars of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey were due to axion-like dark matter piled up in the
center of these stars. These temporary matter/dark matter structures are
characterized by a spacetime geometry rapidly oscillating at frequencies that
depend on the axion mass $m_a$ [Brito {\it et~al.} (2015); Brito {\it et~al.}
(2016)]. Borra (2013) found two additional frequencies, $ f_{1,G} \simeq 9.5$
THz and $f_{2,G} \simeq 8.9$ THz, in the Sloan dataset of galaxies, redshifted
by the cosmological expansion and, for any redshift value, $f_S + f_{2,G} =
f_{1,G}$ is found. Hippke (2019) showed that $f_{2,G}$ is spurious and
introduced by the data analysis procedure due to the nonrandom spacing of the
spectral absorption lines. This was not even found by Isaacson (2019) when
re-observed four of these stars with different instrumentation and data
reduction procedure. Interestingly, Hippke found $f_S$ in the solar spectrum
but not in the Kurucz (2005) artificial solar spectrum whilst its spectral
power estimated by Isaacson resulted below the accepted error $(1\%)$. From
these results, we discuss the validity of our ansatz by analyzing the common
features present in all the spectra. In the worst case, if all the three
frequencies are not real the oscillating axion core models is not valid.
Assuming, instead, the validity of $f_S$ from the results from the analysis of
the solar spectra, those oscillating modes may be transient modes favoring the
axion hypothesis in the mass range $(10^{- 3} < m_a < 2.4 \times 10^{3})~
\mathrm{\mu eV}$, also according to the recent limits from the gamma ray burst
GRB221009A.
