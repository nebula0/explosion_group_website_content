 Modeling the growth histories of specific galaxies often involves generating
the entire population of objects that arise in a given cosmology and selecting
systems with appropriate properties. This approach is highly inefficient when
targeting rare systems such as the extremely luminous high-redshift galaxy
candidates detected by JWST. Here, we present a novel framework for generating
merger trees with branches that are guaranteed to achieve a desired halo mass
at a chosen redshift. This method augments extended Press Schechter theory
solutions with constrained random processes known as Brownian bridges and is
implemented in the open-source semi-analytic model $\texttt{Galacticus}$. We
generate ensembles of constrained merger trees to predict the growth histories
of seven high-redshift JWST galaxy candidates, finding that these systems most
likely merge $\approx 2~\mathrm{Gyr}$ after the observation epoch and occupy
halos of mass $\gtrsim 10^{14}~\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ today. These
calculations are thousands of times more efficient than existing methods, are
analytically controlled, and provide physical insights into the evolution of
halos with rapid early growth. Our constrained merger tree implementation is
publicly available at http://github.com/galacticusorg/galacticus.
