 We present a newly developed data-driven magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
simulation code under a zero-beta approximation based on a method proposed by
Hayashi et al. 2018 and 2019. Although many data-driven MHD simulations have
been developed and conducted, there are not many studies on how accurately
those simulations can reproduce the phenomena observed in the solar corona. In
this study, we investigated the performance of our data-driven simulation
quantitatively using ground-truth data. The ground-truth data was produced by
an MHD simulation in which the magnetic field is twisted by the sunspot
motions. A magnetic flux rope (MFR) is created by the cancellation of the
magnetic flux at the polarity inversion line due to the converging flow on the
sunspot, which eventually leads the eruption of the MFR. We attempted to
reproduce these dynamics using the data-driven MHD simulation. The coronal
magnetic fields are driven by the electric fields, which are obtained from a
time-series of the photospheric magnetic field that is extracted from the
ground-truth data, on the surface. As a result, the data-driven simulation
could capture the subsequent MHD processes, the twisted coronal magnetic field
and formation of the MFR, and also its eruption. We report these results and
compare with the ground-truth data, and discuss how to improve the accuracy and
optimize numerical method.
