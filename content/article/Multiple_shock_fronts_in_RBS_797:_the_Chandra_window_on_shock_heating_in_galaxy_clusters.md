 Using $\sim$427 ks of Chandra observations, we present a study of shock
heating and ICM cooling in the galaxy cluster RBS 797. We discover three nested
pairs of weak shocks at roughly 50 kpc, 80 kpc and 130 kpc from the center. The
total energy associated with the shocks is $\sim6\times10^{61}$ erg, with the
central AGN driving a pair of weak shocks every 20-30 Myr with a power
$P_{sh}\approx10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Based on its morphology and age ($\sim$30
Myr), the inner cocoon shock is associated with the four equidistant X-ray
cavities previously discovered. From the thermodynamic analysis of the inner 30
kpc, we find evidence for ICM condensation into colder gas between and behind
the X-ray cavities. The total AGN mechanical power (cavities and shocks) of
$3.4\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can balance the ICM radiative losses, estimated
as $L_{cool} = 2.3\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. By building plots of $P_{cav}$
vs. $L_{cool}$, $P_{shock}$ vs. $L_{cool}$ and $P_{tot}$ vs. $L_{cool}$ for RBS
797 and 14 other galaxy clusters, groups and elliptical galaxies where both
cavities and shocks are detected, we verify that the most powerful outbursts
are found in the strongest cooling systems. Ultimately, we observe that the
mechanical power of the AGN exceeds the gas radiative losses by a factor that
is different for FR I and FR II radio galaxies, being less than a few tens for
FR Is (as RBS 797) and more than roughly a hundred for FR IIs.
