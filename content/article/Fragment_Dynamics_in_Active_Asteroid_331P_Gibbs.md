 We present a dynamical analysis of the fragmented active asteroid 331P/Gibbs.
Using archival images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope from 2015 to 2018, we
measured the astrometry of the primary and the three brightest (presumably the
largest) components. Conventional orbit determination revealed a high-degree of
orbital similarity between the components. We then applied a fragmentation
model to fit the astrometry, obtaining key parameters including the
fragmentation epochs and separation velocities. Our best-fit models show that
Fragment B separated from the primary body at a speed of $\sim$1 cm s$^{-1}$
between 2011 April and May, whereas two plausible scenarios were identified for
Fragments A and C. The former split either from the primary or from Fragment B,
in 2011 mid-June at a speed of $\sim$8 cm s$^{-1}$, and the latter split from
Fragment B either in late 2011 or between late 2013 and early 2014, at a speed
of $\sim$0.7-0.8 cm s$^{-1}$. The results are consistent with rotational
disruption as the mechanism causing the cascading fragmentation of the
asteroid, as suggested by the rapid rotation of the primary. The fragments
constitute the youngest known asteroid cluster, providing us with a great
opportunity to study asteroid fragmentation and formation of asteroid clusters.
