 We study close encounters of a $1\,M_{\odot}$ middle-age main-sequence star
(modelled using MESA) with massive black holes through hydrodynamic
simulations, and explore in particular the dependence of the outcomes on the
black hole mass. We consider here black holes in the intermediate-mass range,
$M_{\rm BH}= 100-10^4\,M_{\odot}$. Possible outcomes vary from a small tidal
perturbation for weak encounters all the way to partial or full disruption for
stronger encounters. We find that stronger encounters lead to increased mass
loss at the first pericenter passage, in many cases ejecting the partially
disrupted star on an unbound orbit. For encounters that initially produce a
bound system, with only partial stripping of the star, the fraction of mass
stripped from the star increases with each subsequent pericenter passage and a
stellar remnant of finite mass is ultimately ejected in all cases. We also find
that the number of successive close passages before ejection decreases as we go
from the stellar-mass black hole to the intermediate-mass black hole regime.
For instance, after an initial encounter right at the classical tidal
disruption limit, a $1\,M_{\odot}$ star undergoes 16 (5) pericenter passages
before ejection from a $10\,M_{\odot}$ ($100\,M_{\odot}$) black hole.
Observations of consecutive electromagnetic flares from these repeated close
passages could in principle be used to determine the mass of the black hole,
thus possibly proving the existence of intermediate-mass black holes.
