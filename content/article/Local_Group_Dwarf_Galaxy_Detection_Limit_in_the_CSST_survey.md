 We predict the dwarf galaxy detection limits for the upcoming Chinese Space
Station Telescope (CSST) survey that will cover 17,500 deg$^{2}$ of the sky
with a wide field of view of 1.1 deg$^2$. The point-source depth reaches 26.3
mag in the $g$ band and 25.9 mag in the $i$ band. Constructing mock survey data
based on the designed photometric bands, we estimate the recovery rate of
artificial dwarf galaxies from mock point-source photometric catalogues. The
detection of these artificial dwarf galaxies is strongly dependent on their
distance, magnitude and size, in agreement with searches in current surveys. We
expect CSST to enable the detection of dwarf galaxies with $M_V = -3.0$ and
$\mu_{250} = 32.0$ mag/arcsec$^2$ (surface-brightness limit for a system of
half-light radius $r_{\rm h}$ = 250 pc at 400 kpc, and $M_V = -4.9$ and
$\mu_{250} = 30.5$ mag/arcsec$^2$ around the Andromeda galaxy. Beyond the Local
Group, the CSST survey will achieve $M_V = -5.8$, and $\mu_{250}$ = 29.7
mag/arcsec$^2$ in the distance range of 1--2 Mpc, opening up an exciting
discovery space for faint field dwarf galaxies. With its optical bands, wide
survey footprint, and space resolution, CSST will undoubtedly expand our
knowledge of low-mass dwarf galaxies to an unprecedented volume.
