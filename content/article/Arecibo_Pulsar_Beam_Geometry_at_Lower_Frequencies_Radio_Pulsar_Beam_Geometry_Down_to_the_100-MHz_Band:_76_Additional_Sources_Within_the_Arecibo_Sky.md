 This paper provides analyses of the emission beam structure of 76 ``B''-named
pulsars within the Arecibo sky. Most of these objects are included in both the
Gould & Lyne and LOFAR High Band surveys and thus complement our other works
treating various parts of these populations. These comprise a further group of
mostly well studied pulsars within the Arecibo sky that we here treat similarly
to those in Olszanski et.al. and extend our overall efforts to study all of the
pulsars in both surveys. The analyses are based on observations made with the
Arecibo Telescope at 327 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Many have been observed at
frequencies down to 100 MHz using either LOFAR or the Pushchino Radio Astronomy
Observatory as well as a few with the Long Wavelength Array at lower
frequencies. This work uses the Arecibo observations as a foundation for
interpreting the low frequency profiles and emission-beam geometries. We
attempt to build quantitative geometric emission-beam models using the
core/double-cone topology, while reviewing the evidence of previous studies and
arguments for previous classifications on these sources. These efforts were
successful for all but two pulsars, and interesting new subpulse modulation
patterns were identified in a number of the objects. We interpret the Arecibo
pulsar population in the context of the entire population of ``B'' pulsars.
