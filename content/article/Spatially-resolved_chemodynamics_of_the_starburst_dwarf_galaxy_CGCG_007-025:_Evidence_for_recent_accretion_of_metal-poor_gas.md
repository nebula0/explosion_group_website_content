 Nearby metal-poor starburst dwarf galaxies present a unique opportunity to
probe the physics of high-density star formation with a detail and sensitivity
unmatched by any observation of the high-z Universe. Here we present the first
results from a chemodynamical study of the nearby, gas-rich starburst dwarf
CGCG 007-025. We use VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy to characterise the
properties of the star-forming (SF) gas, from its metal content to its
kinematics. The star formation rate (SFR) surface density presents a clumpy
distribution, with the brightest knot hosting a 5 Myr young, Wolf-Rayet (WR)
population (revealed by the presence of the characteristic 5808\AA~WR bump).
The ionised gas kinematics are dominated by disordered motions. A superposition
of a narrow ($\sigma \approx$ 50 km s$^{-1}$), intermediate (150 km s$^{-1}$)
and broad (1000 km s$^{-1}$) kinematic components are needed to model the
emission line profiles in the brightest SF region, suggesting the presence of
energetic outflows from massive stars. The gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy
spans 0.6 dex and displays a strong anti-correlation with SFR surface density,
dropping to 12+log(O/H) = 7.7 in the central SF knot. The spatially-resolved
BPTs indicates the gas is being ionised purely by SF processes. Finally, the
anti-correlation between the SFR and the gas metallicity points out to
accretion of metal-poor gas as the origin of the recent off-centre starburst,
in which the infalling material decreases the metallicity of the gas and
ignites the SF episode.
