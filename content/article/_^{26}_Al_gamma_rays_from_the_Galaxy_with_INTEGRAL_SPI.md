 The presence of radioactive $^{26}$Al at 1.8 MeV reflects ongoing
nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way. Diffuse emission from its decay can be
measured with gamma-ray telescopes in space. The intensity, line shape, and
spatial distribution of the $^{26}$Al emission allow a study of these
nucleosynthesis sources. The line parameters trace massive-star feedback in the
interstellar medium due to its 1~My lifetime. We aim to deepen previous studies
of the $^{26}$Al emission in the Milky Way, using all gamma-ray data including
single and double events as collected with SPI on INTEGRAL from 2003 until
2020. We apply improved spectral response and background as evaluated from
tracing spectral details over the entire mission. The exposure for Galactic
$^{26}$Al emission is enhanced using all event types measured within SPI. We
re-determine the intensity of Galactic $^{26}$Al emission across the entire
sky, through maximum likelihood fits of simulated and model-built sky
distributions to SPI spectra for single and for double detector hits. We find
an all-sky flux of (1.84$\pm$0.03$)\times$10$^{-3}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ in the
1.809~MeV line from $^{26}$Al, determined as fitted to sky distributions from
previous observations with COMPTEL. Significant emission from higher latitudes
indicate an origin from nearby massive-star groups and superbubbles, also
supported by a bottom-up population synthesis model. The line centroid is found
at (1809.83$\pm$0.04~keV, and line broadening from source kinematics integrated
over the sky is (0.62$\pm0.3$)~keV (FWHM).
