 We analyze the physical properties of gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
of 132 Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies at $z=0$ from the cosmological
magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, part of the IllustrisTNG project. The
properties and abundance of CGM gas across the sample are diverse, and the
fractional budgets of different phases (cold, warm, and hot), as well as
neutral HI mass and metal mass, vary considerably. Over our stellar mass range
of $10.5 < \rm{M}_\star / \rm{M}_\odot < 10.9$, radial profiles of gas physical
properties from $0.15 < \rm{R/R_{\rm 200c}} < 1.0$ reveal great CGM structural
complexity, with significant variations both at fixed distance around
individual galaxies, and across different galaxies. CGM gas is multi-phase: the
distributions of density, temperature and entropy are all multimodal, while
metallicity and thermal pressure distributions are unimodal; all are broad. We
present predictions for magnetic fields in MW-like halos: a median field
strength of $|B|\sim\,1\mu$G in the inner halo decreases rapidly at larger
distance, while magnetic pressure dominates over thermal pressure only within
$\sim0.2 \times \RVIR$. Virial temperature gas at $\sim 10^6\,$K coexists with
a sub-dominant cool, $< 10^5\,$K component in approximate pressure equilibrium.
Finally, the physical properties of the CGM are tightly connected to the
galactic star formation rate, in turn dependent on feedback from supermassive
black holes (SMBHs). In TNG50, we find that energy from SMBH-driven kinetic
winds generates high-velocity outflows ($\gtrsim 2000$ km/s), heats gas to
super-virial temperatures ($> 10^{6.5-7}$ K), and regulates the net balance of
inflows versus outflows in otherwise quasi-static gaseous halos.
