 Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) in globular clusters are low mass X-ray
binaries that achieve high X-ray luminosities through a currently uncertain
accretion mechanism. Using archival Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope
observations, we perform a volume-limited search ($\lesssim$ 70 Mpc) of 21 of
the most massive ($>10^{11.5} M_\odot$) early-type galaxies to identify ULXs
hosted by globular cluster (GC) candidates. We find a total of 34 ULX
candidates above the expected background within 5 times the effective radius of
each galaxy, with 10 of these ($\sim29.4\%$) potentially hosted by a GC. A
comparison of the spatial and luminosity distributions of these new candidate
GC ULXs with previously identified GC ULXs shows that they are similar: both
samples peak at $L_X \sim$ a few $\times 10^{39}$ erg/s and are typically
located within a few effective radii of their host galaxies.
