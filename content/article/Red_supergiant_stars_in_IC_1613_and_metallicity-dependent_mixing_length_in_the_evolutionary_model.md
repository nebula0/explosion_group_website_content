 We report a spectroscopic study on red supergiant stars (RSGs) in the
irregular dwarf galaxy IC 1613 in the Local Group. We derive the effective
temperatures ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) and metallicities of 14 RSGs by synthetic
spectral fitting to the spectra observed with the MMIRS instrument on the MMT
telescope for a wavelength range from 1.16 $\mu$m to 1.23 $\mu$m. A weak
bimodal distribution of the RSG metallicity centered on the [Fe/H]=$-0.65$ is
found, which is slightly lower than or comparable to that of the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC). There is no evidence for spatial segregation between
the metal rich ([Fe/H]$>-0.65$) and poor ([Fe/H]$<-0.65$) RSGs throughout the
galaxy. The mean effective temperature of our RSG sample in IC 1613 is higher
by about 250 K than that of the SMC. However, no correlation between
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ and metallicity within our RSG sample is found. We calibrate
the convective mixing length ($\alpha_{\mathrm{MLT}}$) by comparing stellar
evolutionary tracks with the RSG positions on the HR diagram, finding that
models with $\alpha_{\mathrm{MLT}}=2.2-2.4 H_P$ can best reproduce the
effective temperatures of the RSGs in IC 1613 for both Schwarzschild and Ledoux
convection criteria. This result supports our previous study that a metallicity
dependent mixing length is needed to explain the RSG temperatures observed in
the Local Group, but we find that this dependency becomes relatively weak for
RSGs having a metallicity equal to or less than the SMC metallicity.
