 Recent ALMA large surveys unveiled the presence of significant dust continuum
emission in star-forming galaxies at $z>4$. Unfortunately, such large programs
-- i.e. ALPINE ($z\sim 5$) and REBELS ($z \sim 7$) -- only provide us with a
single Far-Infrared (FIR) continuum data point for their individual targets.
Therefore, high-$z$ galaxies FIR spectral energy densities (SEDs) remain mostly
unconstrained, hinging on an assumption for their dust temperature ($T_{\rm
d}$) in the SED fitting procedure. This introduces uncertainties in the
inferred dust masses ($M_{\rm d }$), infrared luminosities ($L_{\rm IR}$), and
obscured Star Formation Rate (SFR) fraction at $z > 4$. In this work we use a
method that allows us to constrain $T_{\rm d}$ with a single band measurement
by combining the $158\ \mathrm{\mu m}$ continuum information with the overlying
[CII] emission line. We analyse the $21$ [CII] and FIR continuum detected
$z\sim 5$ galaxies in ALPINE, finding a range of $T_{\rm d}=25-60\ \mathrm{K}$
and $M_{\rm d} = 0.6-25.1\ \times 10^{7}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Given the
measured stellar masses of ALPINE galaxies, the inferred dust yields are around
$M_{\rm d}/M_{\star} = (0.2-8) \times 10^{-3}$, consistent with theoretical
dust-production constraints. We find that $8$ out of $21$ ALPINE galaxies have
$L_{\rm IR} \geq 10^{12}\ \mathrm{L_{\odot}}$, comparable to UltraLuminous IR
Galaxies (ULIRGs). Relying on ultraviolet-to-optical SED fitting, the SFR was
underestimated by up to $2$ orders of magnitude in $4$ of these $8$ ULIRGs-like
galaxies. We conclude that these $4$ peculiar sources should be characterised
by a two-phase interstellar medium structure with "spatially-segregated" FIR
and ultraviolet emitting regions.
