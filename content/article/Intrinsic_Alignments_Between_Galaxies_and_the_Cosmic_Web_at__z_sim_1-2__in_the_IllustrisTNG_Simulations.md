 Galaxy formation theories predict that galaxy shapes and angular momenta have
intrinsic alignments (IA) with the cosmic web, which provides an observational
test of various theories, and is important to quantify as a nuisance parameter
for weak lensing. We study galaxy IA in the IllustrisTNG suite of
hydrodynamical simulations at redshifts 1 and 2, finding that alignment trends
are consistent with previous studies. However, we find that the magnitude of
the spin alignment signal is $\sim 2.4 \times$ weaker than seen in previous
studies of the Horizon-AGN simulation, suggesting that IA may have significant
dependence on subgrid physics. Based on IllustrisTNG, we then construct mock
observational spectroscopic surveys that can probe shape-cosmic web IA at $z
\sim 1-2$, modeled on the low-$z$ galaxy redshift and IGM tomography surveys on
the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph Galaxy Evolution (PFS GE) survey.
However, even over box sizes of $L=205 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$, we find that
global anisotropies induce a sample variance in the 2D projected IA signal that
depend on the projected direction -- this induces significant errors in the
observed alignment. We predict a $5.3\sigma$ detection of IlustrisTNG's shape
IA signal at $z \sim 1$ from Subaru PFS GE, although a detection would be
challenging at $z \sim 2$. However, a rough rescaling of the relative IA signal
strengths between the TNG and HorizonAGN simulations suggests that PFS GE
should be able to constrain the latter's stronger signal.
