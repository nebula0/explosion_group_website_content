 We analyse photometric observations of the supernova (SN) impostor SN 2000ch
in NGC 3432 covering the time since its discovery. This source was previously
observed to have four outbursts in 2000--2010. Observations now reveal at least
two additional outbursts in 2004-2006, and ten outbursts in 2013-2022. Outburst
light curves are irregular and multipeaked, exhibiting a wide variety of peak
magnitude, duration, and shape. The more recent outbursts (after 2010) repeat
with a period of $198.4\pm{2}$ d, while the pre-2010 period seems to be a few
days shorter. The next outburst should occur around January 2023. We propose
that these periodic eruptions arise from violent interaction around times of
periastron in an eccentric binary system, similar to the periastron encounters
of $\eta$ Carinae leading up to its Great Eruption, and resembling the erratic
pre-SN eruptions of SN 2009ip. We attribute the irregularity of the eruptions
to the interplay between the orbit and the variability of the luminous blue
variable (LBV) primary star, wherein each successive periastron pass may have a
different intensity or duration due to the changing radius and mass-loss rate
of the LBV-like primary. Such outbursts may occasionally be weak or
undetectable if the LBV is relatively quiescent at periastron, but can be much
more extreme when the LBV is active. The observed change in orbital period may
be a consequence of mass lost in outbursts. Given the similarity to the
progenitor of SN 2009ip, SN 2000ch deserves continued attention in the event it
is headed for a stellar merger or a SN-like explosion.
