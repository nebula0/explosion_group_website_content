 Our aim is to understand the effect of environment to galaxy quenching in
various local and global environments. We focus on galaxies with very old
stellar populations (VO galaxies), typically found in the centers of clusters
and groups, and search for such galaxies in the lowest global density
environments, watersheds between superclusters. We use the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey MAIN galaxy sample to calculate the luminosity-density field and get
global density field, to determine groups and filaments, and to obtain data on
galaxy properties. We divide groups into low- and high-luminosity groups based
on the highest luminosity of groups in the watershed region, $L_{gr} = 15
\times10^{12} h^{-2} L_{sun}$. Our study shows that the global density is most
strongly related to the richness of galaxy groups. Its influence on the overall
star formation quenching in galaxies is less strong. Correlations between the
morphological properties of galaxies and the global density field are the
weakest. The watershed regions are populated mostly by single galaxies (70% of
all galaxies there), and by low-luminosity groups. Still, approximately
one-third of all galaxies in the watershed regions are VO galaxies. They have
lower stellar masses, smaller stellar velocity dispersions, and stellar
populations that are up to 2Gyr younger than those of VO galaxies in other
global environments. In higher density global environments, the morphological
properties of galaxies are very similar. Differences in galaxy properties are
the largest between satellites and brightest group galaxies. Our results
suggest that galaxy evolution is determined by the birthplace of galaxies in
the cosmic web, and mainly by internal processes which lead to the present-day
properties of galaxies. This may explain the similarity of (VO) galaxies in
extremely different environments.
