 We present the Spectroscopic Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT)
survey, which is dedicated to spectrophotometric observations of transient
objects such as supernovae and tidal disruption events. SCAT uses the SuperNova
Integral-Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawai'i 2.2-meter
(UH2.2m) telescope. SNIFS was designed specifically for accurate transient
spectrophotometry, including absolute flux calibration and host-galaxy removal.
We describe the data reduction and calibration pipeline including spectral
extraction, telluric correction, atmospheric characterization, nightly
photometricity, and spectrophotometric precision. We achieve $\lesssim 5\%$
spectrophotometry across the full optical wavelength range ($3500-9000~\r{A}$)
under photometric conditions. The inclusion of photometry from the SNIFS
multi-filter mosaic imager allows for decent spectrophotometric calibration
($10-20\%$) even under unfavorable weather/atmospheric conditions. SCAT
obtained $\approx 650$ spectra of transients over the first 3 years of
operations, including supernovae of all types, active galactic nuclei,
cataclysmic variables, and rare transients such as superluminous supernovae and
tidal disruption events. These observations will provide the community with
benchmark spectrophotometry to constrain the next generation of hydrodynamic
and radiative transfer models.
