 We conducted a Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observation of the low mass
active galactic nucleus (AGN) in galaxy NGC 4293 ($z=0.003$). The object is
associated with a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Its
black hole mass is estimated as $\sim10^5$ or $\sim10^7 M_\odot$. The VLBA 1.5
GHz image shows an inverse symmetric structure with two discrete radio blobs
separated by an angular distance of $\sim120$ mas, corresponding to $\sim7$
parsec. Furthermore, its integrated radio spectrum has a turnover at the
frequency of $\sim0.44$ GHz. Based on the compactness and spectrum, the nuclear
radio source in NGC 4293 belongs to a sample of (megahertz) peaked spectrum
(PS/MPS) radio sources with compact symmetric morphologies. NGC 4293 has 1.4
GHz radio power of only $\sim10^{20}\,\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$ with the VLBA
observation, which is consistent with local AGNs but lower than the current PS
samples. One of the two blobs has a steep radio spectrum $\alpha=-0.62\pm0.08$
($S_\nu\propto\nu^{+\alpha}$), while the other one has an inverted spectrum
$\alpha=0.32\pm0.10$. The VLBA 1.5 GHz luminosity ratio of the two blobs is
3.23 and both blobs show lateral-flowing structures where the hotspots reside
at the edge of each radio lobe. This can be explained as jet interactions with
dense circumnuclear medium. We estimate the black hole mass of NGC 4293 through
the fundamental plane of black hole activity, which constrains the black hole
mass to be $\lesssim10^6 M_\odot$. It supports that the object is a low-mass
AGN and a potential candidate for accreting and ejecting IMBHs.
