 The motion of cosmic strings in the universe leads to the generation of wakes
behind them. We study magnetized wakes of cosmic strings moving in the post
recombination plasma. We show that magnetic reconnection can occur in the post
shock region. Since the width of the cosmic string wake is very small, the
reconnection occurs over a very short lengthscale. The reconnection leads to a
large amount of kinetic energy being released in the post shock region of the
cosmic string wake. This enhances the kinetic energy released during the
reconnection. We make a rudimentary estimate of the kinetic energy released by
the magnetic reconnection in cosmic strings wakes and show that it can account
for low energy Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) in the post recombination era.
