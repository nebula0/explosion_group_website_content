 We present long-term (4-10 years) trends of light pollution observed at 26
locations, covering rural, intermediate and urban sites, including the three
major European metropolitan areas of Stockholm, Berlin and Vienna. Our analysis
is based on i) night sky brightness (NSB) measurements obtained with Sky
Quality Meters (SQMs) and ii) a rich set of atmospheric data products provided
by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We describe the SQM
data reduction routine in which we filter for moon- and clear-sky data and
correct for the SQM "aging" effect using an updated version of the twilight
method of Puschnig et al. (2021). Our clear-sky, aging-corrected data reveals
short- and long-term (seasonal) variations due to atmospheric changes. To
assess long-term anthropogenic NSB trends, we establish an empirical
atmospheric model via multi-variate penalized linear regression. Our modeling
approach allows to quantitatively investigate the importance of different
atmospheric parameters, revealing that surface albedo and vegetation have by
far the largest impact on zenithal NSB. Additionally, the NSB is sensitive to
black carbon and organic matter aerosols at urban and rural sites respectively.
Snow depth was found to be important for some sites, while the total column of
ozone leaves impact on some rural places. The average increase in light
pollution at our 11 rural sites is 1.7 percent per year. At our nine urban
sites we measure an increase of 1.8 percent per year and for the remaining six
intermediate sites we find an average increase of 3.7 percent per year. These
numbers correspond to doubling times of 41, 39 and 19 years. We estimate that
our method is capable of detecting trend slopes shallower/steeper than 1.5
percent per year.
