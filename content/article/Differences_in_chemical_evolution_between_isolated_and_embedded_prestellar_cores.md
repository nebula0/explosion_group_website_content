 Models of prestellar cores often assume that the cores are isolated from
their environment - material outside the core boundary plays no role in the
subsequent evolution. This is unlikely to be the case in reality, where cores
are located within hierarchically substructured molecular clouds. We
investigate the dynamical and chemical evolution of prestellar cores, modelled
as Bonnor-Ebert spheres, and show that the density of the ambient medium has a
large impact on the resulting chemical properties of the cores. Models embedded
in high-density, low-temperature surroundings have greatly enhanced abundances
of several molecules, such as CO and CS, compared to models with more diffuse
surroundings, corresponding to relatively isolated cores. The predicted
intensities and profile shapes of molecular lines are also affected. The
density of the ambient medium has a stronger effect on the chemical evolution
than whether the cores are initially in or out of equilibrium. This suggests
that the impact of environment cannot be neglected when modelling chemistry in
prestellar cores; the results of these models are highly sensitive to the
assumptions made about the core surroundings.
