 The intermediate mass black hole range, $10\lesssim M_{\rm
BH}^{}/M_\odot^{}\lesssim 10^{5} $, has long offered enticing possibilities for
primordial black holes (PBH), with populations in this range postulated to be
responsible for some of the LIGO binary merger detected events as well as the
existence of supermassive black holes embedded at galactic centers. However, a
prominent bound derived from PBH accretion during recombination severely
restricts the mass fraction of intermediate mass PBH. We address this problem
by proposing a formation scenario in which "primordial" black holes form late
in our cosmological history, beyond the CMB era, and bypassing this bound.
During this crucial epoch, our population of compact objects exist as thermal
balls supported by thermal pressure, which eventually cool to Fermi balls
supported by degeneracy pressure and finally collapse to PBH. Furthermore, we
present the remarkable possibility of PBH formation after the present era,
which we term future PBH. Such a population would evade most, if not all bounds
on the PBH mass spectrum in the literature and open up previously unthought-of
possibilities. Light future PBH could form below the Hawking evaporation
threshold and convert the bulk of the matter in the Universe into radiation.
