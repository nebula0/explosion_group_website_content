 We continue examining statistical data assimilation (SDA), an inference
methodology, to infer solutions to neutrino flavor evolution, for the first
time using real - rather than simulated - data. The model represents neutrinos
streaming from the Sun's center and undergoing a Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein
(MSW) resonance in flavor space, due to the radially-varying electron number
density. The model neutrino energies are chosen to correspond to experimental
bins in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and Borexino experiments, which
measure electron-flavor survival probability at Earth. The procedure
successfully finds consistency between the observed fluxes and the model, if
the MSW resonance - that is, flavor evolution due to solar electrons - is
included in the dynamical equations representing the model.
