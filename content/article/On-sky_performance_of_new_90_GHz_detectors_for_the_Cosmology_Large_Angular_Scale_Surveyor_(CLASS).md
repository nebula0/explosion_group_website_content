 The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a
polarization-sensitive telescope array located at an altitude of 5,200 m in the
Chilean Atacama Desert and designed to measure the polarized Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) over large angular scales. The CLASS array is currently
observing with three telescopes covering four frequency bands: one at 40 GHz
(Q); one at 90 GHz (W1); and one dichroic system at 150/220 GHz (HF). During
the austral winter of 2022, we upgraded the first 90 GHz telescope (W1) by
replacing four of the seven focal plane modules. These new modules contain
detector wafers with an updated design, aimed at improving the optical
efficiency and detector stability. We present a description of the design
changes and measurements of on-sky optical efficiencies derived from
observations of Jupiter.
