 We present new observational benchmarks of rapid neutron-capture process
(r-process) nucleosynthesis for elements at and between the first (A ~ 80) and
second (A ~ 130) peaks. Our analysis is based on archival ultraviolet and
optical spectroscopy of eight metal-poor stars with Se (Z = 34) or Te (Z = 52)
detections, whose r-process enhancement varies by more than a factor of 30
(-0.22 <= [Eu/Fe] <= +1.32). We calculate ratios among the abundances of Se, Sr
through Mo (38 <= Z <= 42), and Te. These benchmarks may offer a new empirical
alternative to the predicted solar system r-process residual pattern. The Te
abundances in these stars correlate more closely with the lighter r-process
elements than the heavier ones, contradicting and superseding previous
findings. The small star-to-star dispersion among the abundances of Se, Sr, Y,
Zr, Nb, Mo, and Te (<= 0.13 dex, or 26%) matches that observed among the
abundances of the lanthanides and third r-process-peak elements. The concept of
r-process universality that is recognized among the lanthanide and third-peak
elements in r-process-enhanced stars may also apply to Se, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo,
and Te, provided the overall abundances of the lighter r-process elements are
scaled independently of the heavier ones. The abundance behavior of the
elements Ru through Sn (44 <= Z <= 50) requires further study. Our results
suggest that at least one relatively common source in the early Universe
produced a consistent abundance pattern among some elements spanning the first
and second r-process peaks.
