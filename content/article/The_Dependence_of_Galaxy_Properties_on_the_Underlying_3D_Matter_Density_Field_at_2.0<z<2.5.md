 We study the environmental effect of galaxy evolution as a function of the
underlying 3D dark matter density for the first time at $z=2-2.5$, in which the
underlying matter density is reconstructed from galaxy and Ly$\alpha$ forest
spectroscopy through dynamical forward modeling techniques. Utilizing these
maps, we investigate the dependence of the star formation activities and galaxy
types (mergers, submillimeter galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and quiescent
galaxies) on the matter overdensity $\Delta$ and stellar mass. For the first
time, we are able to probe underdense regions ($\Delta <1$) in addition to
overdensities. We find that star formation activity generally depend on the
stellar mass, not the matter density, except for high-mass galaxies
($M_*\geq10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$) which show a drop in star formation activities
by a factor of more than $30$ if they reside in high density regions with
$\Delta\geq4-6$. We also find: (1) an absence of mergers and submillimeter
galaxies in higher-density regions but otherwise no trend across lower-density
bins, (2) the increase of active galactic nuclei and quiescent galaxy
prevalence as a function of matter density, and (3) the increase of all
aforementioned categories with the stellar mass. These results indicate that
mass is the main driver of galaxy evolution. Nonetheless, we also find evidence
for environmental quenching, particularly for high-mass galaxies in
high-density environments. Our novel approach directly using reconstructed dark
matter density maps demonstrates the new capability of the environmental effect
studies in galaxy evolution at higher redshift.
