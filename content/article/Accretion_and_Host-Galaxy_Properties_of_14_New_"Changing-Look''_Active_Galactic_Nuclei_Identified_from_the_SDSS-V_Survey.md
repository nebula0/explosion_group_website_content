 The widely accepted active galactic nucleus (AGN) paradigm has been recently
challenged by the discovery of the so-called ``changing-look'' (CL) phenomenon
characterized by spectral-type transitions. By comparing the SDSS-V and SDSS
DR16 spectroscopic datasets, here we report the identification of 14 new
CL-AGNs (redshift $z<0.5$) exhibiting spectral-type changes on a timescale of
$\sim 10$yr. Follow-up spectroscopy was conducted with the Lick Shane 3m and
Keck 10m telescopes for three of the objects. Detailed analysis of these
spectra enables us to arrive at the following two main results. (1) By
compiling a sample of 65 CL-AGNs with good measurements, we reinforce the
previous claim that CL-AGNs tend to be biased against both a high Eddington
ratio ($\lesssim 0.1$) and a high bolometric luminosity ($\lesssim
10^{46}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$). This bias suggests that the disk-wind
broad-line-region model is a plausible explanation of the CL phenomenon. (2)
The host galaxies of CL-AGNs tend to be dominated by intermediate stellar
populations, which motivates us to propose that CL-AGNs are probably particular
AGNs at a special evolutionary stage, such as a transition stage from ``feast''
to ``famine'' fueling of the supermassive black hole. In addition, with our
spectra, we identify SDSS J025951.22+003744.2 as a new repeat CL narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxy with a rapid ``turn-on'' timescale of $\sim 1$yr.
