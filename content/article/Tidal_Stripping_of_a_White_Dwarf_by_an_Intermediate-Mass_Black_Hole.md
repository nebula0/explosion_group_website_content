 During the inspiralling of a white dwarf (WD) into an intermediate-mass black
hole (~10^{2-5} M_sun), both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM)
radiation are emitted. Once the eccentric orbit's pericenter radius approaches
the tidal radius, the WD would be tidally stripped upon each pericenter
passage. The accretion of these stripped mass would produce EM radiation. It is
suspected that the recently discovered new types of transients, namely the
quasi-periodic eruptions and the fast ultraluminous X-ray bursts, might
originate from such systems. Modeling these flares requires a prediction of the
amount of stripped mass from the WD and the details of the mass supply to the
accretion disk. We run hydrodynamical simulations to study the orbital
parameter dependence of the stripped mass. We find that our results match the
analytical estimate that the stripped mass is proportional to a 5/2-th power of
the excess depth by which the WD overfills its instantaneous Roche lobe at the
pericenter. The corresponding fallback rate of the stripped mass is calculated,
which may be useful in interpreting the individual flaring light curve in
candidate EM sources. We further calculate the long-term mass-loss evolution of
a WD during its inspiral and the detectability of the GW and EM signals. The EM
signal from the mass-loss stage can be easily detected: the limiting distance
is ~320(M_h/10^4 M_sun) Mpc for Einstein Probe. The GW signal, for the
space-borne detectors such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna or TianQin,
can be detected only within the Local Supercluster (~33 Mpc).
