 The extreme space weather conditions resulting from high energetic events
likes solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) demand for reliable space
weather forecasting. The magnetic flux tubes while rising through the
convection zone gets twisted by the turbulent plasma flows, energizing the
system and resulting in flares. We investigate the relationship between the
subsurface plasma flows associated with flaring active regions and their
surface magnetic flux and current helicity. The near-surface horizontal
velocities derived from the ring-diagram analysis of active region patches
using Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) Doppler velocity measurements are
used to compute the fluid dynamics descriptors like vertical divergence,
vorticity and kinetic helicity used in this work. The flaring active regions
are observed to have large value of vertical vorticity and kinetic helicity.
Also, the horizontal flow divergence, vorticity, flux, kinetic and current
helicities are observed to be significantly correlated and evolve in phase with
each other. We observe that the integrated values of the above flow and
magnetic parameters observed one day prior to the flare are significantly
correlated with the integrated flare intensity of the active region. Hence, we
show that strong vorticity/kinetic helicities lead to larger active region
twisting, presumably generating high-intensity flares.
