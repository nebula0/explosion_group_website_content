 Transit and radial-velocity surveys over the past two decades have uncovered
a significant population of short-period exoplanets. Among them are hot
Jupiters, which are gas giant planets with orbital periods of a few days and
found in 0.1-1% of Sun-like stars. Hot Jupiters are expected to be engulfed
during their host star's radial expansion on the red giant branch. Planetary
engulfment has been studied extensively as it may account for observed rapidly
rotating and chemically enriched giant stars. We perform 3D hydrodynamical
simulations of hot Jupiter engulfment by a 1 solar mass, 4 solar radii early
red giant. Our "global" simulations simultaneously resolve the stellar envelope
and planetary structure, modelling the hot Jupiter as a polytropic gas sphere.
We find that approximately 90% of the hot Jupiter's mass is ablated in the
convective part of the giant envelope, which would enhance the surface lithium
abundance by 0.1 dex. The hot Jupiter is disrupted by a combination of ram
pressure and tidal forces near the base of the convective envelope, with the
deepest material penetrating to the radiative zone. The star experiences modest
spin-up (~1 km/s), although engulfing a more massive companion could produce a
rapidly rotating giant. Drag heating near the surface could exceed the
unperturbed stellar luminosity and power an optical transient. For the amount
of unbound ejecta recorded in the simulation, H-recombination could also power
a transient that is around ten times the pre-engulfment luminosity, for several
days.
