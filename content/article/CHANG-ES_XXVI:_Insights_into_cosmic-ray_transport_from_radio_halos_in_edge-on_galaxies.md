 Galactic winds play a key role in regulating the evolution of galaxies over
cosmic time. In recent years, the role of cosmic rays (CR) in the formation of
the galactic wind has increasingly gained attention. Therefore, we use radio
continuum data to analyse the cosmic ray transport in edge-on galaxies. Data
from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 2 at 144 MHz (HBA) and
reprocessed VLA data at 1.6 GHz (L-band) from the Continuum Halos in Nearby
Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) enable us to increase the extent of the
analysed radio continuum profile significantly (up to a factor of 2) compared
to previous studies. We compute thermal emission maps using a mixture approach
of H-alpha and near infrared data, which is then subtracted to yield radio
synchrotron emission maps. Then we compile non-thermal spectral index maps and
compute intensity profiles using a box integration approach. Lastly, we perform
1D cosmic ray transport modelling. The non-thermal spectral index maps show
evidence that the LoTSS maps are affected by thermal absorption, in star
forming regions. The scale height analysis reveals that most of the galaxies
are equally well fitted with an one-component instead of a twocomponent
exponential profile. We find a bi-modality within our sample. While NGC 3432
and NGC 4013 have similar scale heights in the L-band and HBA, the
low-frequency scale heights of NGC 891, NGC 4157, and NGC 4631 exceed their
high-frequency counterpart significantly. The 1D CR transport modelling shows
agreement of the predicted magnetic field strength and the magnetic field
strength estimates of equipartition measurements. Additionally we find an
increasing difference of wind velocities (with increasing height over the
galactic disk) between central and outer regions of the analysed galaxies.
