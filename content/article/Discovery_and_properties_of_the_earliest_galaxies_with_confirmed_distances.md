 Surveys with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have discovered candidate
galaxies in the first 400 Myr of cosmic time. The properties of these distant
galaxies provide initial conditions for understanding early galaxy formation
and cosmic reionisation. Preliminary indications have suggested these candidate
galaxies may be more massive and abundant than previously thought. However,
without spectroscopic confirmation of their distances to constrain their
intrinsic brightnesses, their inferred properties remain uncertain. Here we
report on four galaxies located in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey
(JADES) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imaging with photometric redshifts
$z\sim10-13$ subsequently confirmed by JADES JWST Near- Infrared Spectrograph
(NIRSpec) observations. These galaxies include the first redshift $z>12$
systems both discovered and spectroscopically confirmed by JWST. Using stellar
population modelling, we find the galaxies typically contain a hundred million
solar masses in stars, in stellar populations that are less than one hundred
million years old. The moderate star formation rates and compact sizes suggest
elevated star formation rate surface densities, a key indicator of their
formation pathways. Taken together, these measurements show that the first
galaxies contributing to cosmic reionisation formed rapidly and with intense
internal radiation fields.
