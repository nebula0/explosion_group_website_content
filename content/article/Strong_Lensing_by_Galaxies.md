 Strong lensing at the galaxy-scale is useful for numerous applications in
Astrophysics and Cosmology. Some of the principal applications are studying the
mass structure of elliptical galaxies, their formation and evolution,
constraining the stellar initial mass function, and measuring cosmological
parameters. Since the first discovery of a galaxy-scale strong lens in the
eighties, this field has come a long way in terms of data quality and
availability, and techniques to model the data. In this review article, we
describe the most common methodologies to model lensing observables of
galaxy-scale strong lenses, especially the imaging data due to it being the
most available and informative source of lensing observables. We review the
main results from the literature in astrophysical and cosmological applications
of galaxy-scale strong lenses. We also discuss the current limitations of the
data and methodologies, and provide a future outlook of the expected
development and improvements in both aspects in the near future.
