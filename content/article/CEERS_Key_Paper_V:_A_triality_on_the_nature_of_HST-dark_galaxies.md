 The new capabilities that JWST offers in the near- and mid-infrared (IR) are
used to investigate in unprecedented detail the nature of optical/near-IR
faint, mid-IR bright sources, the so-called HST-dark galaxies among them. We
gather JWST data from the CEERS survey in the EGS, jointly with HST data, to
face this task by analyzing spatially resolved optical-to-mid-IR spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) to estimate both photometric redshifts and stellar
populations properties in two dimensions. We select 138 galaxies with
F150W-F356W>1.5 mag, F356W<27.5 mag, which include faint-to-dark HST galaxies
(H>24 mag). The nature of these sources is threefold: (1) 71% are dusty
star-forming galaxies at 2<z<6 with masses 9<log M/M_sun<11 and a variety of
specific SFRs (<1 to >100 Gyr^-1); (2) 18% are quiescent/dormant (i.e., subject
to reignition and rejuvenation) galaxies at 3<z<5, masses log M/M_sun~10 and
post-starburst stellar mass-weighted ages (0.5-1 Gyr); and (3) 11% are strong
young starbursts with indications of high-EW emission lines at 6<z<7 and log
M/M_sun~9.5. Morphologically, the sample is biased towards disk-like galaxies
with a remarkable compactness for XELG-z6 (effective radii smaller than 0.4
kpc). Large attenuations in SFGs, 2<A(V)<5 mag, are found within 1.5 times the
effective radius, approximately 2 kpc. Our technique reproduces the expected
dust emission luminosities of IR-bright and sub-millimeter galaxies. Our
results imply high levels of star formation activity between z~20 and z~10,
where virtually 100% of our galaxies had already formed 10^8 M_sun of their
stellar content, 60% of them had assembled 10^9 M_sun, and 10% up to 10^10
M_sun (in situ or ex situ). (abridged)
