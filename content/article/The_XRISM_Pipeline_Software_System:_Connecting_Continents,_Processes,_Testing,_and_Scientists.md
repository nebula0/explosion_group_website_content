 XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission), with the Resolve
high-resolution spectrometer and the Xtend wide-field imager on-board, is
designed to build on the successes of the abbreviated Hitomi mission to address
outstanding astrophysical questions using high resolution X-ray spectroscopy.
In preparation for launch, the XRISM Science Data Center (SDC) is constructing
and testing an integrated and automated system for data transfer and processing
based upon the Hitomi framework, introducing improvements informed by previous
experience and internal collaboration. The XRISM pipeline ingests FITS files
transferred from Japan that contain data converted from spacecraft telemetry,
processes (calibrates and screens) the data, creates data products, and
transfers data and metadata used to populate data archives in the U.S. and
Japan. Improvement and rigorous testing of the system are conducted from the
single-task level through fully-integrated levels. We provide an overview of
the XRISM pipeline system, with a focus on the data processing, and how new and
improved documentation and testing are creating accessible and effective
software tools for future XRISM data.
