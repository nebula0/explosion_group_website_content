 Given their extremely faint apparent brightness, the nature of the first
galaxies and how they reionized the Universe's gas are not yet understood. Here
we report the discovery, in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, of a
highly magnified, low-mass (log(M_*/M_sol)=7.70^{+0.11}_{-0.09}) galaxy visible
when the Universe was only 510 Myr old, and follow-up prism spectroscopy of the
galaxy extending from Lyman alpha to [O III] 5007 in its rest frame. Our JWST
spectrum provides [O III] 5007 and H beta detections with a respective
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 33 and 7, as well as four additional lines with
S/N > 2. These emission lines yield a redshift of z=9.51 and star-formation
rate of 0.26^{+0.07}_{-0.05} M_sol per year. The galaxy's large inferred value
of [O III]/[O II] = 16 +- 6 suggests that this galaxy has an escape fraction of
ionizing radiation larger than 10%, indicating that a population of similar
objects could contribute substantially to the reionization budget. Using
multiple techniques, we infer a gas oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.47 +-
0.10 dex, consistent within 2 sigma of the mass-metallicity relation observed
for dwarf galaxies in the local Universe.
