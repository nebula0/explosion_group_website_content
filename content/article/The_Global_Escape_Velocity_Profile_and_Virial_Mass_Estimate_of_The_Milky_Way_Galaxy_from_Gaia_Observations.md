 Gaia HyperVelocity Star (HVS) kinematic observations favor a local escape
velocity of ~700 km/s, nearly forty-percent greater than conventional
estimates. Combining HVS and dwarf galaxy satellite data reveal the global
escape velocity profile for the Galaxy smoothly traces an unbroken Keplerian
decline from the central bar to the most remote satellite galaxy. We reveal a
robust upper bound in baryonic mass discrepancy (maximal relative
accelerations) linked to the virial theorem and obtain a fundamental and
universal mass discrepancy-acceleration relation for virialized compact cosmic
objects.
