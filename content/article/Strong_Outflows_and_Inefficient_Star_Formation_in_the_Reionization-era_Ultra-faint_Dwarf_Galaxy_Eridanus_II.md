 We present novel constraints on the underlying galaxy formation physics
(e.g., mass loading factor, star formation history, metal retention) at $z
\gtrsim 7$ for the low-mass ($M_*\sim10^5$ M$_\odot$) Local Group ultra-faint
dwarf galaxy (UFD) Eridanus II (Eri II) Using a hierarchical Bayesian
framework, we apply a one-zone chemical evolution model to Eri II's CaHK-based
photometric metallicity distribution function (MDF; [Fe/H]) and find that the
evolution of Eri II is well-characterized by a short, exponentially declining
star-formation history ($\tau_\text{SFH} = 0.39\pm_{0.13}^{0.18}$ Gyr), a low
star-formation efficiency ($\tau_\text{SFE} = 27.56\pm_{12.92}^{25.14}$ Gyr),
and a large mass-loading factor ($\eta = 194.53\pm_{42.67}^{33.37}$). Our
results are consistent with Eri II forming the majority of its stars before the
end of reionization. The large mass-loading factor is consistent with strong
outflows in Eri II and is in good agreement with theoretical predictions for
momentum-driven galactic winds. It also results in the ejection of $>$90% of
the metals produced in Eri II. We make predictions for the distribution of
[Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] in Eri II as well as the prevalence of ultra metal-poor stars,
both of which can be tested by future chemical abundance measurements.
Spectroscopic follow-up of the highest metallicity stars in Eri II
($\text{[Fe/H]}> -2$) will greatly improve model constraints. Our new framework
can readily be applied to all UFDs throughout the Local Group, providing new
insights in to the underlying physics governing the evolution of the faintest
galaxies in the reionization-era.
