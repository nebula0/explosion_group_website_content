 Very little is known about the young planet population because the detection
of small planets orbiting young stars is obscured by the effects of stellar
activity and fast rotation which mask planets within radial velocity and
transit data sets. The few planets that have been discovered in young clusters
generally orbit stars too faint for any detailed follow-up analysis. Here we
present the characterization of a new mini-Neptune planet orbiting the bright
(V=9) and nearby K2 dwarf star, HD 18599. The planet candidate was originally
detected in TESS light curves from Sectors 2, 3, 29, and 30, with an orbital
period of 4.138~days. We then used HARPS and FEROS radial velocities, to find
the companion mass to be 25.5$\pm$4.6~M$_\oplus$. When we combine this with the
measured radius from TESS, of 2.70$\pm$0.05~R$_\oplus$, we find a high
planetary density of 7.1$\pm$1.4~g cm$^{-3}$. The planet exists on the edge of
the Neptune Desert and is the first young planet (300 Myr) of its type to
inhabit this region. Structure models argue for a bulk composition to consist
of 23% H$_2$O and 77% Rock and Iron. Future follow-up with large ground- and
space-based telescopes can enable us to begin to understand in detail the
characteristics of young Neptunes in the galaxy.
