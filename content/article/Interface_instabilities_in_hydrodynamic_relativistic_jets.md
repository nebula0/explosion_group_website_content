 Both the dynamics and the observational properties of relativistic jets are
determined by their interaction with the ambient medium. A crucial role is
played by the contact discontinuity at the jet boundary, which in the presence
of jet collimation may become subject to Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) and
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI). Here, we study the evolution of these
instabilities in non-magnetized relativistic jets using special relativistic
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We show that the growth of initial
perturbations is consistent with relativistic RTI operating in the jet
collimation region. The contribution of RMI becomes important downstream from
the collimation shock in agreement with theoretical expectations. Both
instabilities reach non-linear scales above the shock convergence point and
trigger strong turbulence, mixing jet with ambient matter. We devise an
analytic solution for the mixing rate and show that it is sensitive to the
external density gradients. Our results may be applied to different types of
astrophysical objects. In particular, different contribution of interface
instabilities is a natural explanation for the observed dichotomy between FR-I
and FR-II radiogalaxies. The rapid slow-down in the jet of M87 is consistent
with baryon entrainment from the circumnuclear matter with the observed density
distribution. In microquasars, baryon loading triggered by interface
instabilities is a probable reason for the low observed Lorentz factors. We
show that the observed variability in gamma-ray bursts cannot come from mixing
driven by interface instabilities and likely originates from the engine,
suggesting the presence of magnetic fields in the jet.
