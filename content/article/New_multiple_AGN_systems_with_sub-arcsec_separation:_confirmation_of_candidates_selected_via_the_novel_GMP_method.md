 The existence of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGN) at small projected
distances on the sky is due to either the presence of multiple, in-spiraling
SMBHs, or to gravitational lensing of a single AGN. Both phenomena allow us to
address important astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, few
kpc-separation multiple AGN are currently known. Recently, the newly-developed
Gaia Multi peak (GMP) method provided numerous new candidate members of these
populations. We present spatially resolved, integral-field spectroscopy of a
sample of four GMP-selected multiple AGNs candidates. In all of these systems,
we detect two or more components with sub-arcsec separations. We find that two
of the systems are dual AGNs, one is either an intrinsic triple or a lensed
dual AGN, while the last system is a chance AGN/star alignment. Our
observations double the number of confirmed multiple AGNs at projected
separations below 7 kpc at z > 0.5, present the first detection of a possible
triple AGN in a single galaxy at z > 0.5, and successfully test the GMP method
as a novel technique to discover previously unknown multiple AGNs.
