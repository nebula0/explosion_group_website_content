 We present an efficient heating/cooling method coupled with chemistry and
ultraviolet (UV) radiative transfer, which can be applied to numerical
simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM). We follow the time-dependent
evolution of hydrogen species (H$_2$, H, H$^+$), assume carbon/oxygen species
(C, C$^+$, CO, O, and O$^+$) are in formation-destruction balance given the
non-steady hydrogen abundances, and include essential heating/cooling processes
needed to capture thermodynamics of all ISM phases. UV radiation from discrete
point sources and the diffuse background is followed through adaptive ray
tracing and a six-ray approximation, respectively, allowing for H$_2$
self-shielding; cosmic ray (CR) heating and ionization are also included. To
validate our methods and demonstrate their application for a range of density,
metallicity, and radiation field, we conduct a series of tests, including the
equilibrium curves of thermal pressure vs. density, the chemical and thermal
structure in photo-dissociation regions, H I-to-H$_2$ transitions, and the
expansion of H II regions and radiative supernova remnants. Careful treatment
of photochemistry and CR ionization is essential for many aspects of ISM
physics, including identifying the thermal pressure at which cold and warm
neutral phases co-exist. We caution that many current heating and cooling
treatments used in galaxy formation simulations do not reproduce the correct
thermal pressure and ionization fraction in the neutral ISM. Our new model is
implemented in the MHD code Athena and incorporated in the TIGRESS simulation
framework, for use in studying the star-forming ISM in a wide range of
environments.
