 Feeding with gas in streams is predicted to be an important galaxy growth
mechanism. Using an idealised setup, we study the impact of stream feeding
(with 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ rate) on the star formation and outflows of
disc galaxies with $\sim$10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ baryonic mass. The
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations are carried out with the PIERNIK code and
include star formation, feedback from supernova, and cosmic ray advection and
diffusion. We find that stream accretion enhances galactic star formation.
Lower angular momentum streams result in more compact discs, higher star
formation rates and stronger outflows. In agreement with previous studies,
models including cosmic rays launch stronger outflows travelling much further
into the galactic halo. Cosmic ray supported outflows are also cooler than
supernova only driven outflows. With cosmic rays, the star formation is
suppressed and the thermal pressure is reduced. We find evidence for two
distinct outflow phases. The warm outflows have high angular momentum and stay
close to the galactic disc, while the hot outflow phase has low angular
momentum and escapes from the centre deep into the halo. Cosmic rays can
therefore have a strong impact on galaxy evolution by removing low angular
momentum, possibly metal enriched gas from the disc and injecting it into the
circumgalactic medium.
