 In this Letter, we show that the nonthermal nature of dark matter freeze-in
production leads to large, totally correlated dark matter-photon isocurvature
perturbations, which are imprinted in anisotropies of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). Isocurvature is typically expected from inflationary physics,
but the isocurvature from freeze-in arises post inflation. We compute the
freeze-in of millicharged dark matter, generated from electron-positron
annihilations in the early Universe. We find that current CMB observations from
\textit{Planck} exclude this scenario for dark matter masses between 1 MeV and
10 GeV at more than $2\sigma$, whereas upcoming CMB experiments will have the
sensitivity to reach at least the $4\sigma$ level. We anticipate any scenario
in which dark matter is nonthermally produced to generically give rise to
isocurvature. Our work opens a new avenue for exploring fundamental dark matter
physics through its impact on cosmological observables.
