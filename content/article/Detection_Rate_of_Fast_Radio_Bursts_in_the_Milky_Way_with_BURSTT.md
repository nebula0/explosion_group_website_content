 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense bursts of radio emission with durations
of milliseconds. Although researchers have found them happening frequently all
over the sky, they are still in the dark to understand what causes the
phenomena because the existing radio observatories have encountered certain
challenges during the discovery of FRB progenitors. The construction of
Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is being proposed
to solve these challenges. We simulate mock Galactic FRB-like events by
applying a range of spatial distributions, pulse widths and luminosity
functions. The effect of turbulent Interstellar Medium (ISM) on the
detectability of FRB-like events within the Milky Way plane is considered to
estimate the dispersion measure and pulse scattering of mock events. We
evaluate the fraction of FRB-like events in the Milky Way that are detectable
by BURSTT and compare the result with those by Survey for Transient
Astronomical Radio Emission 2 (STARE2) and Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX). We
find that BURSTT could increase the detection rate by more than two orders of
magnitude compared with STARE2 and GReX, depending on the slope of luminosity
function of the events. We also investigate the influence of the specifications
of BURSTT on its detection improvement. This leads to the fact that greatly
higher sensitivity and improved coverage of the Milky Way plane have
significant effects on the detection improvement of BURSTT. We find that the
upgrade version of BURSTT, BURSTT-2048 could increase the detection rate of
faint Galactic FRB-like events by a factor of 3.
