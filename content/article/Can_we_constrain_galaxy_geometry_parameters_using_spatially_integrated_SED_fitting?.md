 Sophisticated spectral energy distribution (SED) models describe dust
attenuation and emission using geometry parameters. This treatment is natural
since dust effects are driven by the underlying star-dust geometry in galaxies.
An example is the Starduster SED model, which divides a galaxy into a stellar
disk, a stellar bulge, and a dust disk. This work utilises the Starduster SED
model to study the efficacy of inferring geometry parameters using spatially
integrated SED fitting. Our method fits the SED model to mock photometry
produced by combining a semi-analytic model with the same SED model. Our
fitting results imply that the disk radius can be constrained, while the
inclination angle, dust disk to stellar disk radius ratio, bulge radius and
intrinsic bulge to total luminosity ratio are unconstrained, even though 21
filters from UV to FIR are used. We also study the impact of S/N, finding that
the increase of S/N (up to 80) brings limited improvements to the results. We
provide a detailed discussion to explain these findings, and point out the
implications for models with more general geometry.
