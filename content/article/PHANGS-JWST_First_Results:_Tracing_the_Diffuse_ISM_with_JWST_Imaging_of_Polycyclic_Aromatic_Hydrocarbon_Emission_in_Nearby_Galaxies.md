 JWST observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission provide
some of the deepest and highest resolution views of the cold interstellar
medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. If PAHs are well mixed with the atomic and
molecular gas and illuminated by the average diffuse interstellar radiation
field, PAH emission may provide an approximately linear, high resolution, high
sensitivity tracer of diffuse gas surface density. We present a pilot study
that explores using PAH emission in this way based on MIRI observations of IC
5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury. Using
scaling relationships calibrated in Leroy et al. (2022), scaled F1130W provides
10--40 pc resolution and 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of $\Sigma_{\rm gas} \sim 2$
M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. We characterize the surface densities of structures seen
at $< 7$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ in our targets, where we expect the gas to be
HI-dominated. We highlight the existence of filaments, inter-arm emission, and
holes in the diffuse ISM at these low surface densities. Below $\sim 10$
M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ for NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 the gas distribution
shows a ``Swiss cheese''-like topology due to holes and bubbles pervading the
relatively smooth distribution of diffuse ISM. Comparing to recent galaxy
simulations, we observe similar topology for the low surface density gas,
though with notable variations between simulations with different setups and
resolution. Such a comparison of high resolution, low surface density gas with
simulations is not possible with existing atomic and molecular gas maps,
highlighting the unique power of JWST maps of PAH emission.
