 We study the origin of the anomalous deep absorption in a spectrum of the
SDSS J110511.15+530806.5 distant quasar (z=1.929) obtained by the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey in Data Release 7 of the optical catalog. We aim to estimate the
velocity of absorbing material, and we show that this material considerably
affects our measurements of the black hole (BH) mass in massive quasars with
the use of common virial mass estimators. The spectral shape of the quasar was
modeled assuming that the accretion disk emission is influenced by a hot
corona, warm skin, and absorbing material located close to the nucleus. The
whole analysis was undertaken with XSPEC models and tools. The overall spectral
shape was represented with the AGNSED model, while the deep absorption is well
described by two Gaussians. The observed spectrum and the fitting procedure
allowed us to estimate the BH mass in the quasar as $3.52 \pm 0.01 \times 10^9
M_{\odot}$, the nonzero BH spin is $a_* = 0.32 \pm 0.04$, and the accretion
rate is $\dot m=0.274 \pm 0.001$. The velocities of the detected absorbers lie
in the range of 6330-108135 km/s. When we consider that absorption is caused by
the CIV ion, one absorber is folding toward the nucleus with a velocity of
73887 km/s. We derived a BI index of about 20300 km/s and a mass outflow rate
up to 38.5 % of the source accretion rate. The high absorption observed in SDSS
J110511.15+530806.5 is evidence of fast winds that place the source in the
group of objects on the border with UFO (ultra-fast outflows), strong broad
absorption line (BAL), and fast failed radiatively accelerated dusty outflow
(FRADO). This absorption affects the BH mass measurement by two orders of
magnitude as compared to virial mass estimation.
