 We conducted one-dimensional stellar evolutionary numerical simulations to
build blue supergiant stellar models with a very low-envelope mass and a
super-Eddington luminosity of 10^7Lo that mimic the last phase of a common
envelope evolution (CEE) where a neutron star (NS) accretes mass from the
envelope and launches jets that power the system. Common envelope jets
supernovae (CEJSNe) are CEE transient events where a NS spirals-in inside the
envelope and then the core of a red supergiant (RSG) star accretes mass and
launches jets that power the transient event. In case that the NS (or black
hole) does not enter the core of the RSG the event is a CEJSN-impostor. We
propose that in some cases a CEJSN-impostor event might end with such a phase
of a blue supergiant lasting for several years to few ten years. The radius of
the blue supergiant is about tens to few hundreds solar radii. We use a simple
prescription to deposit the jets energy into the envelope. We find that the
expected accretion rate of envelope mass onto the NS at the end of the CEE
allows the power of the jets to be as we assume, 10^7Lo. Such a low-mass
envelope might be the end of the RSG envelope, or might be a rebuilt envelope
from mass fallback. Our study of a blue supergiant at the termination of a
CEJSN-impostor event adds to the rich variety of transients that CEJSNe and
CEJSN-impostors might form.
