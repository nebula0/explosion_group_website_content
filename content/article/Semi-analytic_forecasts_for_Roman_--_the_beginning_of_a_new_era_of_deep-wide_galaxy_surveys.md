 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, NASA's next flagship observatory, will
redefine deep-field galaxy survey with a field of view two orders of magnitude
larger than Hubble and an angular resolution of matching quality. These future
deep-wide galaxy surveys necessitate new simulations to forecast their
scientific output and to optimise survey strategies. In this work, we present
five realizations of 2-deg^2 lightcones, containing a total of >25 million
simulated galaxies with -16 < MUV < -25 spanning z ~ 0 to 10. This dataset
enables a new set of experiments with the impacts of survey size on the derived
galaxy formation and cosmological constraints. The intrinsic and observable
galaxy properties are predicted using a well-established, physics-based
semi-analytic modelling approach. We provide forecasts for number density,
cosmic SFR, field-to-field variance, and angular two-point correlation
functions, and demonstrate how the future wide-field surveys will be able to
improve these measurements relative to current generation surveys. We also
present a comparison between these lightcones and others that have been
constructed with empirical models. The mock lightcones are designed to
facilitate the exploration of multi-instrument synergies and connecting with
current generation instruments and legacy surveys. In addition to Roman, we
also provide photometry for a number of other instruments on upcoming
facilities, including Euclid and Rubin, as well as the instruments that are
part of many legacy surveys. Full object catalogues and data tables for the
results presented in this work are made available through a web-based,
interactive portal https://www.simonsfoundation.org/semi-analytic-forecasts.
