 Gamma-ray flares of blazars may be accompanied by high-energy neutrinos due
to interactions of high-energy cosmic rays in the jet with photons, as
suggested by the detection of the high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A during a
major gamma-ray flare from blazar TXS 0506+056 at the $\sim3\sigma$
significance level. In this work, we present a statistical study of gamma-ray
emission from blazars to constrain the contribution of gamma-ray flares to
their neutrino output. We construct weekly binned light curves for 145
gamma-ray bright blazars in the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT)
Monitored Source List. We derive the fraction of time spent in the flaring
state (flare duty cycle) and the fraction of energy released during each flare
from the light curves with a Bayesian blocks algorithm. We find that blazars
with lower flare duty cycles and energy fractions are more numerous among our
sample. We identify no significant differences between blazar sub-classes in
terms of flaring activity. Then using a general scaling relation for the
neutrino and gamma-ray luminosities, $L_{\nu} \propto (L_{\gamma})^{\gamma}$
with a weighting exponent of ${\gamma} = 1.0 - 2.0$, normalized to the
quiescent gamma-ray or X-ray flux of each blazar, we evaluate the neutrino
energy flux of each gamma-ray flare. The gamma-ray flare distribution indicates
that blazar neutrino emission may be dominated by flares for
$\gamma\gtrsim1.5$. The neutrino energy fluxes for one-week and 10-year bins
are compared with the declination-dependent IceCube sensitivity to constrain
the standard neutrino emission models for gamma-ray flares. Finally, we present
the upper-limit contribution of blazar gamma-ray flares to the isotropic
diffuse neutrino flux.
