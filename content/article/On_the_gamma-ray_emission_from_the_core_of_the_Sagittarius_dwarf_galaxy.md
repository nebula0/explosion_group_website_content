 We use data from the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi gamma-ray space
telescope (Fermi-LAT) to analyze the faint gamma-ray source located at the
center of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. In the 4FGL-DR3
catalog, this source is associated with the globular cluster, M54, which is
coincident with the dynamical center of this dwarf galaxy. We investigate the
spectral energy distribution and spatial extension of this source, with the
goal of testing two hypotheses: (1) the emission is due to millisecond pulsars
within M54, or (2) the emission is due to annihilating dark matter from the Sgr
halo. For the pulsar interpretation, we consider a two-component model which
describes both the lower-energy magnetospheric emission and possible
high-energy emission arising from inverse Compton scattering. We find that this
source has a point-like morphology at low energies, consistent with
magnetospheric emission, and find no evidence for a higher-energy component.
For the dark matter interpretation, we find that this signal favors a dark
matter mass of $m_{\chi} = 29.6 \pm 5.8$ GeV and an annihilation cross section
of $\sigma v = (2.1 \pm 0.59) \times 10^{-26} \,\text{cm}^3/$s for the $b
\bar{b}$ channel (or $m_{\chi} = 8.3 \pm 3.8$ GeV and $\sigma v = (0.90 \pm
0.25) \times 10^{-26} \, \text{cm}^3/$s for the $\tau^+ \tau^-$ channel), when
adopting a J-factor of $J=10^{19.6} \, \text{GeV}^2 \, \text{cm}^{-5}$. This
parameter space is consistent with gamma-ray constraints from other dwarf
galaxies and with dark matter interpretations of the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray
Excess.
