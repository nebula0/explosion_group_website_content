 Thermonuclear and core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) are the nebular
leftovers of defunct stars. Their morphology and emission properties provide
insights into the evolutionary history of the progenitor star. But while some
SNRs are spherical, as expected from a point-like explosion expanding into a
roughly uniform medium, many others exhibit complex non-spherical morphologies
which are often not easily explained. In this work, we use three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations to show that rectangular and jet-like
morphologies can be explained by supernovae (SNe), either type Ia or type II,
expanding within anisotropic, bipolar stellar wind bubbles driven by the
progenitor star. The stellar wind has an anisotropic density distribution,
which channels the SN ejecta differently depending on the anisotropy
characteristics. We compute synthetic thermal (X-ray) and non-thermal
(synchrotron) emission maps from our numerical simulations to compare with
observations. We find rectangular morphologies are generated when the stellar
wind has a high mass loss rate and forms a dense, narrow disk at the equatorial
region. Instead, a jet-like or ear-like morphology is obtained when the stellar
wind develops a wide, dense disk. Stellar winds with low mass-loss rates do not
strongly influence the SNR morphology. Finally, our synthetic synchrotron and
X-ray maps for the high mass-loss rate case qualitatively agree with the
observations of the SNRs G332.5-5.6 and G290.1-0.8.
