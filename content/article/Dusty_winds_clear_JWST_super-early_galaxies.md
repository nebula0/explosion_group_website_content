 The JWST discovery of a number of super-early (redshift $z>10$), blue
galaxies requires these systems to be essentially dust-free in spite of their
large stellar masses. A possible explanation is that dust is evacuated by
radiatively-driven outflows. We test this hypothesis by deriving the Eddington
ratio, $\lambda_E$, for 134 galaxies at $6.5< z <16$. We find a strong
anti-correlation between $\lambda_E$ and dust UV optical depth, $\tau_{1500}
\propto \lambda_E^{-0.63}$; also, $\lambda_E$ increases with redshift. We
confirm that galaxies exceeding a specific star formation rate ${\rm sSFR} >
13\, \rm Gyr^{-1}$ develop powerful outflows clearing the galaxy from its dust.
This result is supported by ALMA dust continuum non-detections in three
super-early systems
