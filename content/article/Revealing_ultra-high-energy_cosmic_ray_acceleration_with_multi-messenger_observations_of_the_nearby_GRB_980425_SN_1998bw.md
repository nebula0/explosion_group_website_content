 The origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the most
mystifying issues in astroparticle physics. It has been suggested that
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are excellent acceleration sites for cosmic rays. The
propagation of UHECRs from the GRB host galaxy to the Earth should generate
delayed secondary photons and neutrinos. Here we present a dedicated search for
delayed UHECR and neutrino emission centered around the position of nearby GRB
980425/SN 1998bw. Located at a distance of 36.9 Mpc, GRB 980425/SN 1998bw is
well within the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) distance horizon. We find no
evidence for UHECR or neutrino clustering around the GRB 980425/SN 1998bw
position between 2004 and 2020. Under ideal propagation conditions, we propose
that it might be possible to detect an excess from delayed UHECRs around GRB
980425/SN 1998bw within the next 100 years if the intergalactic magnetic field
(IGMF) strength is $B \leq 3 \times 10^{-13}$ G.
