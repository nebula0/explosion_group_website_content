 Aims. We validate a semi-analytical model for the covariance of real-space
2-point correlation function of galaxy clusters. Methods. Using 1000 PINOCCHIO
light cones mimicking the expected Euclid sample of galaxy clusters, we
calibrate a simple model to accurately describe the clustering covariance.
Then, we use such a model to quantify the likelihood analysis response to
variations of the covariance, and investigate the impact of a
cosmology-dependent matrix at the level of statistics expected for the Euclid
survey of galaxy clusters. Results. We find that a Gaussian model with
Poissonian shot-noise does not correctly predict the covariance of the 2-point
correlation function of galaxy clusters. By introducing few additional
parameters fitted from simulations, the proposed model reproduces the numerical
covariance with 10 per cent accuracy, with differences of about 5 per cent on
the figure of merit of the cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and
$\sigma_8$. Also, we find that the cosmology-dependence of the covariance adds
valuable information that is not contained in the mean value, significantly
improving the constraining power of cluster clustering. Finally, we find that
the cosmological figure of merit can be further improved by taking mass binning
into account. Our results have significant implications for the derivation of
cosmological constraints from the 2-point clustering statistics of the Euclid
survey of galaxy clusters.
