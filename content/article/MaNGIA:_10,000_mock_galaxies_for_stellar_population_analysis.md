 Modern astronomical observations give unprecedented access to the physical
properties of nearby galaxies, including spatially resolved stellar
populations. However, observations can only give a present-day view of the
Universe, whereas cosmological simulations give access to the past record of
the processes that galaxies have experienced in their evolution. To connect the
events that happened in the past with galactic properties as seen today,
simulations must be taken to a common ground before being compared to
observations. We emulate data from the MaNGA survey, which is the largest
integral field spectroscopic galaxy survey to date with its 10,000 nearby
galaxies of all types. For this, we use the cosmological simulations TNG50 to
generate MaNGIA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies with IllustrisTNG Astrophysics), a
mock MaNGA sample of similar size that emulates observations of galaxies for
stellar population analysis. We choose TNG galaxies to match the MaNGA sample
selection to limit the impact of selection effects. We produce MaNGA-like
datacubes from all simulated galaxies, and process these with the pyPipe3D
analysis code. This allows us to extract spatially resolved stellar maps. This
first paper presents the approach to generate the mock sample and provides an
initial exploration of its properties. We show that the stellar populations and
kinematics of the simulated MaNGIA galaxies are overall in good agreement with
observations. Specific discrepancies, especially in the age and metallicity
gradients in low- to intermediate-mass regimes and in massive galaxies'
kinematics, require further investigation. We compare our results to other
attempts to mock similar observations, all of smaller data sets. Our final
dataset will be released with the publication, consisting of >10,000
post-processed data-cubes analysed with pyPipe3D, along with the codes
developed to create it.
