 We present evidence that the nebular cocoon and bow-shock emission nebula
putatively and recently reported as deriving from the 9th magnitude "runaway"
star HD 185806 is the previously discovered but obscure planetary nebula WHTZ 1
(Ra 7). It has a Gaia DR3 G~16 blue ionizing star at its geometric centre. We
present imagery, spectroscopy, other data and arguments to support that this
emission source is a high excitation Planetary Nebula not a stellar wind bow
shock.
