 We show that the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework has
an instability towards the growth of fluid flow anisotropies, even if the
Universe is accelerating. This flow (tilt) instability in the matter sector is
invisible to Cosmic No-Hair Theorem-like arguments, which typically only flag
shear anisotropies in the metric. We illustrate our claims in the setting of
``dipole cosmology'', the maximally Copernican generalization of FLRW that can
accommodate a flow. Simple models are sufficient to show that the cosmic flow
need not track the shear, even in the presence of a positive cosmological
constant. We also emphasize that the growth of the tilt hair is fairly generic
if the total equation of state $w(t) \rightarrow -1$ at late times (as it does
in standard cosmology), irrespective of the precise model of dark energy.
