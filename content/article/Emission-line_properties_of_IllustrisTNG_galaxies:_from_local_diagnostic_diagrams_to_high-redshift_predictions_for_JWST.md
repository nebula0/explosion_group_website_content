 We compute synthetic, rest-frame optical and ultraviolet (UV) emission-line
properties of galaxy populations at redshifts from z$\approx$0 to z=8 in a full
cosmological framework. We achieve this by coupling, in post-processing, the
cosmological IllustrisTNG simulations with new-generation nebular-emission
models, accounting for line emission from young stars,
post-asymptotic-giant-branch (PAGB) stars, accreting black holes (BHs) and, for
the first time, fast radiative shocks. The optical emission-line properties of
simulated galaxies dominated by different ionizing sources are largely
consistent with those expected from classical diagnostic diagrams and reflect
the observed increase in OIII/H$\beta$ at fixed NII/H$\alpha$ and the
evolution of the H$\alpha$, OIII$\lambda5007$ and OII$\lambda3727$
luminosity functions from z$\approx$0 to z$\sim$2. At higher redshift, we find
that the emission-line galaxy population is dominated by star-forming and
active galaxies, with negligible fractions of shock- and PAGB-dominated
galaxies. We highlight 10 UV-diagnostic diagrams able to robustly identify the
dominant ionizing sources in high-redshift galaxies. We also compute the
evolution of several optical- and UV-line luminosity functions from z=4 to z=7,
and the number of galaxies expected to be detectable per field of view in deep,
medium-resolution spectroscopic observations with the NIRSpec instrument on
board the James Webb Space Telescope. We find that 2-hour-long exposures are
sufficient to achieve unbiased censuses of H$\alpha$ and OIII$\lambda5007$
emitters, while at least 5 hours are required for H$\beta$, and even 10 hours
will detect only progressively smaller fractions of OII$\lambda3727$,
OIII]$\lambda1663$, CIII]$\lambda1908$, CIV$\lambda1550$, NII$\lambda6584$,
SiIII]$\lambda1888$ and HeII$\lambda1640$ emitters, especially in the presence
of dust.
