        Emission lines with a double-peak (DP) shape, detected in the centre of <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxies</span>, have been extensively used in the past to identify peculiar kinematics such as dual active galactic nuclei, outflows or <span class="search-hit mathjax">mergers</span>. From a large DP <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxy</span> sample, a connection to minor <span class="search-hit mathjax">merger</span> <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxies</span> with ongoing star formation was suggested. To gain a better understanding of different mechanisms creating a DP signature, we here explore synthetic SDSS spectroscopic observations computed from disc models and simulations. We show how a DP signature is connected to the central part of the rotation curve of <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxies</span>, which is mostly shaped by the stellar bulge. We, furthermore, find that bars can create strong DP emission-line signatures when viewed along their major axis. Major <span class="search-hit mathjax">mergers</span> can form a central rotating disc in late post-coalescence <span class="search-hit mathjax">merger</span> stages (1\,Gyr after the final coalescence), which creates a DP signature. Minor <span class="search-hit mathjax">mergers</span> tend to show a DP feature with no correlation to the <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxy</span> inclination within 350\,Myr after the final coalescence. Comparisons of these scenarii with observations disfavour major <span class="search-hit mathjax">mergers</span>, since these show predominantly elliptical and only a few S0 morphologies. Furthermore, at such a late <span class="search-hit mathjax">merger</span> stage the enhanced star formation is most likely faded. Bars and minor <span class="search-hit mathjax">mergers</span>, on the other hand, can be compared quite well with the observations. Both observations coincide with increased star formation found in observations, and minor <span class="search-hit mathjax">mergers</span> in particular do not show any dependency with the observation direction. However, observations resolving the <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxy</span> kinematics spatially are needed to distinguish between the discussed possibilities. More insight into the origin of DP will be gained by a broader comparison with cosmological simulations. The understanding of the DP origin can provide important tools to study the mass growth of <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxies</span> in future high redshift surveys.
