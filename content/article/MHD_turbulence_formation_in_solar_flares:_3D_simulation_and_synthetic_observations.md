 Turbulent plasma motion is common in the universe, and invoked in solar
flares to drive effective acceleration leading to high energy electrons.
Unresolved mass motions are frequently detected in flares from extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) observations, which are often regarded as turbulence.
However, how this plasma turbulence forms during the flare is still largely a
mystery. Here we successfully reproduce observed turbulence in our 3D
magnetohydrodynamic simulation where the magnetic reconnection process is
included. The turbulence forms as a result of an intricate non-linear
interaction between the reconnection outflows and the magnetic arcades below
the reconnection site, in which the shear-flow driven Kelvin-Helmholtz
Instability (KHI) plays a key role for generating turbulent vortices. The
turbulence is produced above high density flare loops, and then propagates to
chromospheric footpoints along the magnetic field as Alfvenic perturbations.
High turbulent velocities above 200 km s^-1 can be found around the termination
shock, while the low atmosphere reaches turbulent velocities of 10 km s^-1 at a
layer where the number density is about 10^11 cm^-3. The turbulent region with
maximum non-thermal velocity coincides with the region where the observed
high-energy electrons are concentrated, demonstrating the potential role of
turbulence in acceleration. Synthetic views in EUV and fitted Hinode-EIS
spectra show excellent agreement with observational results. An energy analysis
demonstrates that more than 10% of the reconnection downflow kinetic energy can
be converted to turbulent energy via KHI.
