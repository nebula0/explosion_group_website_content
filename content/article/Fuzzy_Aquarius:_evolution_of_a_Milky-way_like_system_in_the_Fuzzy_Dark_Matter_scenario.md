 We present the first high-resolution zoom-in simulation of a Milky-way-like
halo extracted from the Aquarius Project in the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM)
framework. We use the N-body code AX-GADGET, based on a particle oriented
solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equations, able to detail the
complexity of structure formation while keeping track of the quantum effects in
FDM. The halo shows a cored density profile, with a core size of several kpc
for a FDM mass of $m_{\chi}=2.5h \times 10^{-22}\ {\rm eV}/c^2$. A flattening
is observed also in the velocity profile, representing a distinct feature of
FDM dynamics. We provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of fuzziness on
satellites in terms of abundance, mass, distance and velocity distribution
functions and their evolution with redshift. Very interestingly, we show that
all collapsed structures, despite showing a flat density profile at $z=0$, do
not reach the solitonic ground-state at the time of formation: on the contrary,
they asymptotically converge to it on a timescale that depends on their mass
and formation history. This implies that current limits on FDM mass - obtained
by applying simple scaling relations to observed galaxies - should be taken
with extreme care, since single objects can significantly deviate from the
expected asymptotic behavior during their evolution.
