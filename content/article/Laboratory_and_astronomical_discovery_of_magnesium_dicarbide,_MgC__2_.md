 We report the detection of magnesium dicarbide, MgC$_2$, in the laboratory at
centimeter wavelengths and assign $^{24}$MgC$_2$, $^{25}$MgC$_2$, and
$^{26}$MgC$_2$ to 14 unidentified lines in the radio spectrum of the
circumstellar envelope of the evolved carbon star IRC+10216. The structure of
MgC$_2$ is found to be T-shaped with a highly ionic bond between the metal atom
and the C$_2$ unit, analogous to other dicarbides containing electropositive
elements. A two-temperature excitation model of the MgC$_2$ emission lines
observed in IRC+10216 yields a very low rotational temperature of $6\pm1$ K, a
kinetic temperature of $22\pm13$ K, and a column density of $(1.0 \pm 0.3)
\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. The abundance of MgC$_2$ relative to the
magnesium-carbon chains MgCCH, MgC$_4$H, and MgC$_6$H is $1{:}2{:}22{:}20$ and
provides a new constraint on the sequential radiative association-dissociative
recombination mechanisms implicated in the production of metal-bearing
molecules in circumstellar environments.
