 Titan's northern high latitudes host many large hydrocarbon lakes. Like water
lakes on Earth, Titan's lakes are constantly subject to evaporation. This
process strongly affects the atmospheric methane abundance, the atmospheric
temperature, the lake mixed layer temperature, and the local wind circulation.
In this work we use a 2D atmospheric mesoscale model coupled to a slab lake
model to investigate the effect of solar and infrared radiation on the exchange
of energy and methane between Titan's lakes and atmosphere. The magnitude of
solar radiation reaching the surface of Titan through its thick atmosphere is
only a few W/m2. However, we find that this small energy input is important and
is comparable in absolute magnitude to the latent and sensible heat fluxes, as
suggested in the prior study by S. Rafkin and A. Soto (Icarus, 2020).
  The implementation of a gray radiative scheme in the model confirms the
importance of radiation when studying lakes at the surface of Titan. Solar and
infrared radiation change the energy balance of the system leading to an
enhancement of the methane evaporation rate, an increase of the equilibrium
lake temperature almost completely determined by its environment (humidity,
insolation, and background wind), and a strengthening of the local sea breeze,
which undergoes diurnal variations. The sea breeze efficiently transports
methane vapor horizontally, from the lake to the land, and vertically due to
rising motion along the sea breeze front and due to radiation-induced
turbulence over the land.
