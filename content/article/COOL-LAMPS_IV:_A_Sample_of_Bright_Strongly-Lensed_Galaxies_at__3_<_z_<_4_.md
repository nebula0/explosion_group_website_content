 We report the discovery of five bright strong gravitationally-lensed galaxies
at $3 < z < 4$: COOL J0101$+$2055 ($z = 3.459$), COOL J0104$-$0757 ($z =
3.480$), COOL J0145$+$1018 ($z = 3.310$), COOL J0516$-$2208 ($z = 3.549$), and
COOL J1356$+$0339 ($z = 3.753$). These galaxies have magnitudes of $r_{\rm AB},
z_{\rm AB} < 21.81$ mag and are lensed by galaxy clusters at $0.26 < z < 1$.
This sample doubles the number of known bright lensed galaxies with extended
arcs at $3 < z < 4$. We characterize the lensed galaxies using ground-based
grz/giy imaging and optical spectroscopy. We report model-based magnitudes and
derive stellar masses, dust content, and star-formation rates via
stellar-population synthesis modeling. Building lens models based on
ground-based imaging, we estimate source magnifications ranging from $\sim$29
to $\sim$180. Combining these analyses, we derive demagnified stellar masses
ranging from $\rm log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) \sim 9.7 - 11.0$ and star formation
rates in the youngest age bin ranging from $\rm log_{10}(SFR/(M_{\odot}\cdot
yr^{-1})) \sim 0.4 - 1.6$, placing the sample galaxies on the massive end of
the star-forming main sequence in this redshift interval. In addition, three of
the five galaxies have strong Ly$\alpha$ emissions, offering unique
opportunities to study Ly$\alpha$ emitters at high redshift in future work.
