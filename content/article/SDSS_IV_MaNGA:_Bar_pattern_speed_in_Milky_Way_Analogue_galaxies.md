 Most secular effects produced by stellar bars strongly depend on the pattern
speed. Unfortunately, it is also the most difficult observational parameter to
estimate. In this work, we measured the bar pattern speed of 97 Milky-Way
Analogue galaxies from the MaNGA survey using the Tremaine-Weinberg method. The
sample was selected by constraining the stellar mass and morphological type. We
improve our measurements by weighting three independent estimates of the disc
position angle. To recover the disc rotation curve, we fit a kinematic model to
the H$_\alpha$ velocity maps correcting for the non-circular motions produced
by the bar. The complete sample has a smooth distribution of the bar pattern
speed ($\Omega_{Bar}=28.14^{+12.30}_{-9.55}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc $^{-1}$),
corotation radius ($R_{CR} = 7.82^{+3.99}_{-2.96}$ kpc) and the rotation rate
($\mathcal{R} = 1.35^{+0.60}_{-0.40}$). We found two sets of correlations: (i)
between the bar pattern speed, the bar length and the logarithmic stellar mass
(ii) between the bar pattern speed, the disc circular velocity and the bar
rotation rate. If we constrain our sample by inclination within $30 \degree < i
< 60 \degree$ and relative orientation $20\degree<|PA_{disc}-PA_{bar}
|<70\degree$, the correlations become stronger and the fraction of ultra-fast
bars is reduced from 20\% to 10\% of the sample. This suggest that a
significant fraction of ultra-fast bars in our sample could be associated to
the geometric limitations of the TW-method. By further constraining the bar
size and disc circular velocity, we obtain a sub-sample of 25 Milky-Way
analogues galaxies with distributions $\Omega_{Bar}=30.48^{+10.94}_{-6.57}$ km
s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, $R_{CR} = 6.77^{+2.32}_{-1.91}$ kpc and $\mathcal{R} =
1.45^{+0.57}_{-0.43}$, in good agreement with the current estimations for our
Galaxy.
