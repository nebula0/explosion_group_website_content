 The gas-phase metallicity of galaxies encodes important information about
galaxy evolution processes, in particular star formation, feedback, outflows
and gas accretion, the relative importance of which can be extracted from
systematic trends in the scatter of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR). Here,
we use a sample of low redshift (0.02<z<0.055) galaxies from SDSS to
investigate the nature of the scatter around the MZR, the observables and
physical processes causing it, and its dependence on galaxy mass. We use cold
gas masses inferred from optical emission lines using the technique of Scholte
& Saintonge (2023) to confirm that at fixed stellar mass, metallicity and gas
mass are anti-correlated, but only for galaxies up to M*=10^10.5Msun. In that
mass regime, we find a link between the offset of a galaxy from the MZR and
halo mass, using the amplitude of the two-point correlation function as a proxy
for halo mass; at fixed stellar mass, the most gas-poor galaxies reside in the
most massive halos. This observation can be explained via changes in gas
accretion rates onto galaxies as a function of halo mass, as predicted by
simulations. At higher stellar masses, the scatter of the MZR correlates only
very weakly with gas mass and halo mass, but a stronger trend is found with AGN
activity. These results confirm expectations from models and simulations that
metallicity is set by the interplay between gas in- and outflows, star
formation, and AGN feedback, shaping the MZR and its scatter.
