 We present emission-line measurements and physical interpretations for a
sample of 117 [OIII] emitting galaxies at $z=5.33-6.93$, using the first deep
JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopic observations. Our 9.7-hour
integration is centered upon the $z=6.3$ quasar J0100+2802 -- the first of six
fields targeted by the EIGER survey -- and covers $\lambda=3-4$ microns. We
detect 133 [OIII] doublets, but merge pairs within $\approx$10 kpc and 600 km
s$^{-1}$, motivated by their small scale clustering excess. We detect H$\beta$
in 68 and H$\gamma$ in two galaxies. The galaxies are characterised by a UV
luminosity M$_{\rm UV}\sim-19.7$ ($-17.7$ to $-22.3$), mass ~$10^8$
$(10^{6.8-9.8})$ M$_{\odot}$, H$\beta$ and [OIII] EWs $\approx$ 1000 Angstrom
(up to 3000 Angstrom), young ages (~5 Myr), a highly excited interstellar
medium ([OIII]/H$\beta\approx6$) and low dust attenuations. These high EWs are
very rare in the local Universe, but we show they are ubiquitous at $z\sim6$
based on the measured number densities. The stacked spectrum reveals H$\gamma$
and [OIII]$_{4364}$ which shows that the galaxies are typically dust and metal
poor (E(B-V)=0.1, 12+log(O/H)=7.4) with a high electron temperature
($2\times10^4$ K) and a high production efficiency of ionising photons
($\xi_{\rm ion}=10^{25.6}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$). We further show the existence of a
strong mass-metallicity relation as expected by simulations. The young highly
ionising stellar populations, moderately low metallicities, low dust
attenuations and high ionisation state in z~6 galaxies conspire to maximise the
[OIII] output from galaxies, yielding an [OIII] luminosity density at z~6 that
is significantly higher than at z~2, despite the order of magnitude decline in
cosmic star formation. Thus, [OIII] emission-line surveys with JWST prove a
highly efficient method to trace the galaxy density in the epoch of
reionization.
