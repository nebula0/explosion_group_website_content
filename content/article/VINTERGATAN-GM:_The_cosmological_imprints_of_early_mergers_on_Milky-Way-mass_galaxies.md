 We present a new suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical ($\approx 20\,
\mathrm{pc}$) simulations of Milky-Way mass galaxies to study how a varying
mass ratio for a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) progenitor impacts the $z=0$
chemodynamics of halo stars. Using the genetic modification approach, we create
five cosmological histories for a Milky-Way-mass dark matter halo ($M_{200}
\approx 10^{12} \, M_\mathrm{\odot}$), incrementally increasing the stellar
mass ratio of a $z\approx2$ merger from 1:25 to 1:2, while fixing the galaxy's
final dynamical, stellar mass and large-scale environment. We find markedly
different morphologies at $z=0$ following this change in early history, with a
growing merger resulting in increasingly compact and bulge-dominated galaxies.
Despite this structural diversity, all galaxies show a radially-biased
population of inner halo stars like the Milky-Way's GSE which, surprisingly,
has a similar magnitude, age, $\rm [Fe/H]$ and $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$ distribution
whether the $z\approx2$ merger is more minor or major. This arises because a
smaller ex-situ population at $z\approx2$ is compensated by a larger population
formed in an earlier merger-driven starburst, with both populations strongly
overlapping in the $\rm [Fe/H]-\rm [\alpha/Fe]$ plane. Our study demonstrates
that multiple high-redshift histories can lead to similar $z=0$ chemodynamical
features in the halo, highlighting the need for additional constraints to
distinguish them, and the importance of considering the full spectrum of
progenitors when interpreting $z=0$ data to reconstruct our Galaxy's past.
