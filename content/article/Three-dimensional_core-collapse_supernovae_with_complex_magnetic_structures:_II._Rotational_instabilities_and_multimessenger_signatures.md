 The gravitational collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars can lead to the
onset of the low $T/\|W\|$ instability within the central proto-neutron star
(PNS), which leaves strong signatures in both the gravitational wave (GW) and
neutrino emission. Strong large-scale magnetic fields are usually invoked to
explain outstanding stellar explosions of rapidly rotating progenitors, but
their impact on the growth of such instability has not yet been cleared. We
analyze a series of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic models to
characterize the effects of different magnetic configurations on the
development of the low $T/\|W\|$ and the related multi-messenger features. In
the absence of magnetic fields, we observe the growth on dynamical time scales
of the low $T/\|W\|$, associated with a strong burst of GW and a correlated
modulation of the neutrino emission. However, models with a strong magnetic
field show a quenching of the low $T/\|W\|$, due to a flattening of the
rotation profile in the first $\sim100$ ms after shock formation caused by the
magnetic transport of angular momentum. The associated GW emission is weakened
by an order of magnitude, exhibits a broader spectral shape, and has no
dominant feature associated with the PNS large-scale oscillation modes.
Neutrino luminosities are damped along the equatorial plane due to a more
oblate PNS, and the only clear modulation in the signal is due to SASI
activity. Finally, magnetized models produce lower luminosities for $\nu_e$
than for $\bar{\nu}_e$, which is connected to a higher concentration of
neutron-rich material in the PNS surroundings.
