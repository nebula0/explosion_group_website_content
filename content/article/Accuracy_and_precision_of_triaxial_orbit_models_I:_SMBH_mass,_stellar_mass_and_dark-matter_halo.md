 We investigate the accuracy and precision of triaxial dynamical orbit models
by fitting two dimensional mock observations of a realistic N-body merger
simulation resembling a massive early-type galaxy with a supermassive black
hole (SMBH). We show that we can reproduce the triaxial N-body merger remnant's
correct black hole mass, stellar mass-to-light ratio and total enclosed mass
(inside the half-light radius) for several different tested orientations with
an unprecedented accuracy of 5-10%. Our dynamical models use the entire
non-parametric line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) rather than
parametric LOSVDs or velocity moments as constraints. Our results strongly
suggest that state-of-the-art integral-field projected kinematic data contain
only minor degeneracies with respect to the mass and anisotropy recovery.
Moroever, this also demonstrates the strength of the Schwarzschild method in
general. We achieve the proven high recovery accuracy and precision with our
newly developed modeling machinery by combining several advancements: (i) our
new semi-parametric deprojection code probes degeneracies and allows to
constrain the viewing angles of a triaxial galaxy; (ii) our new orbit modeling
code SMART uses a 5-dim orbital starting space to representatively sample in
particular near-Keplerian orbits in galaxy centers; (iii) we use a generalised
information criterion AICp to optimise the smoothing and to compare different
mass models to avoid biases that occur in $\chi^2$-based models with varying
model flexibilities.
