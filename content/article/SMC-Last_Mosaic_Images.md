 We present mosaic images of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) observed with
the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m bands over two epochs, 2017 August
25 to 2017 September 13, and 2017 November 24 to 2018 February 12. The survey
region comprises $\sim$30 square degrees covering the SMC and the Bridge to the
Large Magellanic Cloud. The region is covered by 52
$\sim$1$.\!\!^\circ$1$\times$1$.\!\!^\circ$1 tiles, with each tile including
images in each band for both separate and combined epochs. The mosaics are made
in individual tangent projections in J2000 coordinates. The angular pixel size
is 0$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$6 with a resolution (FWHM) of
$\sim$2$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$0. We describe processing to correct or mitigate
residual artifacts and remove background discontinuities. The mosaic images are
publicly available at the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA).
