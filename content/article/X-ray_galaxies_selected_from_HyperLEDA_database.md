 We cross-matched the 4XMM-DR10 catalog with the HyperLEDA database and
obtained the new sample of galaxies that contain X-ray sources. Excluding
duplicate observations and false matches, we present a total of 7759 galaxies
with X-ray sources. In the current work, we present general properties of the
sample: namely the distribution in equatorial coordinates, radial velocity
distribution, morphological type, and X-ray fluxes. The sample includes
morphological classification for 5241 galaxies with X-ray emission, almost half
of which, 42\%, are elliptical (E, E-S0). Most galaxies in the sample have
nuclear X-ray emission (6313 or 81\%), and the remaining 1443 (19\%) present
X-ray emission from the host galaxy. This sample can be used for future deep
studies of multi wavelengths properties of the galaxies with X-ray emission.
