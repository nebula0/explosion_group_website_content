 We calculate the properties of 135 stellar supernovae using data from the
Open Supernova Catalog. We generate temperatures, radii, luminosities, and
expansion velocities using a spherically symmetric optically thick fireball
model. These modeled parameters reveal trends that are common across different
types of supernovae. We have identified distinct phases that appear across Type
Ia, II, II P, and IIb supernovae. We note that there is a long period of
reasonable continuous growth (Phase 1), giving credence to our simple model of
an optically thick fireball. The modeled radius reaches a maximum value beyond
which it is flat or decreases (Phase 2). The temperature we observe at the
maximum modeled radius, 4500 K, suggests that the loss of opacity due to
electron recombination sets the timeline where our optically thick model no
longer applies. We observe the fastest modeled fireball velocities, largest
modeled fireball radii, and maximum modeled luminosities for Type Ia
supernovae. As a group, Type Ia supernovae reach a maximum luminosity that is
8.5 times more luminous than Type II supernovae. We present a summary table
that contains modeled parameters of supernovae and their timings by supernova
classification type.
