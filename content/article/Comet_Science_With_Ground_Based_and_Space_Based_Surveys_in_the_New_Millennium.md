 We summarize the comet science provided by surveys. This includes surveys
where the detections of comets are an advantageous benefit but were not part of
the survey\'s original intent, as well as some pointed surveys where comet
science was the goal. Many of the surveys are made using astrophysical and
heliophysics assets. The surveys in our scope include those using ground-based
as well as space-based telescope facilities. Emphasis is placed on current or
recent surveys, and science that has resulted since the publication of Comets
II, though key advancements made by earlier surveys (e.g. IRAS, COBE, NEAT,
etc.) will be mentioned. The proportionally greater number of discoveries of
comets by surveys have yielded in turn larger samples of comet populations and
sub-populations for study, resulting in better defined evolutionary trends.
While providing an array of remarkable discoveries, most of the survey data has
been only cursorily investigated. It is clear that continuing to fund ground-
and space-based surveys of large numbers of comets is vital if we are to
address science goals that can give us a population-wide picture of comet
properties.
