 Over 150 resolved, kpc-scale X-ray jets hosted by active galactic nuclei have
been discovered with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. A significant fraction of
these jets have an X-ray spectrum either too high in flux or too hard to be
consistent with the high-energy extension of the radio-to-optical synchrotron
spectrum, a subtype we identify as Multiple Spectral Component (MSC) X-ray
jets. A leading hypothesis for the origin of the X-rays is the inverse-Compton
scattering of the cosmic microwave background by the same electron population
producing the radio-to-optical synchrotron spectrum (known as the IC/CMB
model). In this work, we test the IC/CMB model in 45 extragalactic X-ray jets
using observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope to look for the expected
high level of gamma-ray emission, utilizing observations from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) when
possible to best constrain the predicted gamma-ray flux. Including this and
previous works, we now find the IC/CMB model to be ruled out in a total of
24/45 MSC X-ray jets due to its overprediction for the observed MeV-to-GeV
gamma-ray flux. We present additional evidence against the IC/CMB model,
including the relative X-ray-to-radio relativistic beaming in these sources,
and the general mismatch between radio and X-ray spectral indexes. Finally, we
present upper limits on the large scale bulk-flow Lorentz factors for all jets
based on the Fermi upper limits, which suggest that these jets are at most
mildly relativistic.
