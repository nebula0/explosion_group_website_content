 The Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR) has been strongly endorsed as
a top community priority by both Astronomy & Astrophysics Decadal Surveys and
Solar & Space Physics Decadal Surveys in the past two decades. Although it was
developed to a high state of readiness in previous years (it went through a
CATE analysis and was declared ``doable now"), the NSF has not had the funding
mechanisms in place to fund this mid-scale program. Now it does, and the
community must seize this opportunity to modernize the FASR design and build
the instrument in this decade. The concept and its science potential have been
abundantly proven by the pathfinding Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA),
which has demonstrated a small subset of FASR's key capabilities such as
dynamically measuring the evolving magnetic field in eruptive flares, the
temporal and spatial evolution of the electron energy distribution in flares,
and the extensive coupling among dynamic components (flare, flux rope, current
sheet). The FASR concept, which is orders of magnitude more powerful than
EOVSA, is low-risk and extremely high reward, exploiting a fundamentally new
research domain in solar and space weather physics. Utilizing dynamic broadband
imaging spectropolarimetry at radio wavelengths, with its unique sensitivity to
coronal magnetic fields and to both thermal plasma and nonthermal electrons
from large flares to extremely weak transients, the ground-based FASR will make
synoptic measurements of the coronal magnetic field and map emissions from the
chromosphere to the middle corona in 3D. With its high spatial, spectral, and
temporal resolution, as well as its superior imaging fidelity and dynamic
range, FASR will be a highly complementary and synergistic component of solar
and heliospheric capabilities needed for the next generation of solar science.
