 The rotational properties of astrophysical black holes are fundamental
quantities that characterization the black holes. A new method to empirically
determine the spin mass-energy characteristics of astrophysical black holes is
presented and applied here. Results are obtained for a sample of 100
supermassive black holes with collimated dual outflows and redshifts between
about zero and two. An analysis indicates that about two-thirds of the black
holes are maximally spinning, while one-third have a broad distribution of spin
values; it is shown that the same distributions describe the quantity
$\rm{(M_{rot}/M_{irr})}$. The new method is applied to obtain the black hole
spin mass-energy, $\rm{M_{spin}}$, available for extraction relative to: the
maximum possible value, the irreducible black hole mass, and the total black
hole mass, $\rm{M_{dyn}}$. The total energy removed from the black hole system
and deposited into the circumgalactic medium via dual outflows over the entire
outflow lifetime of the source, $\rm{E_T}$, is studied relative to
$\rm{M_{dyn}}$ and relative to the spin energy available per black hole,
$\rm{E_{spin}/(M_{\odot}c^2)}$. The mean value of $\rm{Log(E_T/M_{dyn})}$ is
about $(-2.47\pm 0.27)$. Several explanations of this and related results are
discussed. For example, the energy input to the ambient gas from the outflow
could turn off the accretion, or the impact of the black hole mass loss on the
system could destabilize and terminate the outflow. The small values and
restricted range of values of $\rm{Log(E_T/M_{dyn})}$ and
$\rm{Log(E_T/E_{spin})}$ could suggest that these are fundamental properties of
the primary process responsible for producing the dual collimated outflows.
