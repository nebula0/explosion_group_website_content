 The remnant phase of a radio galaxy is characterized by the cessation of AGN
activity resulting in the stoppage of jets supplying plasma to radio lobes. In
this paper, we present the search and characterization of remnant candidates in
12.5 deg$^{2}$ of the {\em XMM$-$Newton} Large$-$Scale Structure (XMM$-$LSS)
field by using deep radio observations at 325 MHz from the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT), at 150 MHz from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), at 1.4
GHz from the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and at 3 GHz from the VLA Sky
Survey (VLASS). By using both morphological criteria {\viz}undetected radio
core as well as spectral criteria {\viz}high spectral curvature, and
ultra$-$steep spectrum, we identify 21 remnant candidates that are found to
reside mostly in non$-$cluster environments, and exhibit diverse properties in
terms of morphology, spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm 150}^{\rm 1400}$ in the range
of $-1.71$ to $-0.75$ with a median of $-1.10$), and linear radio size (ranging
from 242 kpc to 1.3 Mpc with a median of 469 kpc). Our study attempts to
identify remnant candidates down to the flux density limit of 6.0 mJy at 325
MHz, and yields an upper limit on the remnant fraction ($f_{\rm rem}$) to be
around 5$\%$. The observed $f_{\rm rem}$ seems consistent with the predictions
of an evolutionary model assuming power law distributions of the duration of
active phase and jet kinetic power with index $-0.8$ to $-1.2$.
