 We present LOFAR imaging observations from the April/May 2020 active episode
of magnetar SGR 1935+2154. We place the earliest radio limits on persistent
emission following the low-luminosity fast radio burst FRB 200428 from the
magnetar. We also perform an image-plane search for transient emission and find
no radio flares during our observations. We examine post-FRB radio upper limits
in the literature and find that all are consistent with the multi-wavelength
afterglow predicted by the synchrotron maser shock model interpretation of FRB
200428. However, early optical observations appear to rule out the simple
versions of the afterglow model with constant-density circumburst media. We
show that these constraints may be mitigated by adapting the model for a
wind-like environment, but only for a limited parameter range. In addition, we
suggest that late-time non-thermal particle acceleration occurs within the
afterglow model when the shock is no longer relativistic, which may prove vital
for detecting afterglows from other Galactic FRBs. We also discuss future
observing strategies for verifying either magnetospheric or maser shock FRB
models via rapid radio observations of Galactic magnetars and nearby FRBs.
