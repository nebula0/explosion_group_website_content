        We report the discovery of a rare early-type <span class="search-hit mathjax">dwarf</span> <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxy</span> (dE), SDSS J125651.47+163024.2 (hereafter dE1256), possessing a tidal feature that was likely built up by accretion of an even smaller <span class="search-hit mathjax">dwarf</span> <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxy</span>. dE1256 is located in a nearly isolated environment, at the outskirt of the Virgo cluster. A detailed morphological examination reveals that the accreted stellar population is mainly deposited in the outer part of dE1256, where the tidal tail is most prominent. The inner part of dE1256 is perfectly modeled with a simple Sérsic function of index n = 0.63 and half-light radius R$_{h}$ = 0.6 kpc, but in contrast, the entire <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxy</span> has a size of R$_{h}$ = 1.2 kpc. The mass ratio between the host and the putative accreted <span class="search-hit mathjax">dwarf</span> <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxy</span> is calculated to be 5:1, assuming that the observed two components, inner Sérsic, and outer tidal tail residual, represent the host&#39;s and accreted <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxy&#39;s</span> stellar populations, respectively. We suggest that while the accretion contributes only 20% of the overall stellar population, the size of dE1256 grew by a factor of two via the accretion event. Our results provide, for the first time, strong observational evidence that a dE is undergoing a two-phase growth, a common phenomenon for massive <span class="search-hit mathjax">galaxies</span>.
