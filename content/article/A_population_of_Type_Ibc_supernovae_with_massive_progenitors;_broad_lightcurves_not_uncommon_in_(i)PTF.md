 If high-mass stars (>20-25 Msun) are the progenitors of stripped-envelope
(SE) supernovae (SNe), their massive ejecta should lead to broad, long-duration
lightcurves (LCs). Instead, literature samples of SE~SNe have reported
relatively narrow LCs with ejecta masses between 1-4 Msun that favor
progenitors <20-25 Msun. Working with the untargeted sample of (i)PTF SNe to
better constrain their rates, we search for SE~SNe with broad LCs. Using a
simple LC stretch compared to a template to measure broadness, we identified
eight significantly broader Type~Ibc SNe after applying quantitative sample
selection criteria. The LCs, colors, and spectra of these SNe are found to
evolve more slowly relative to typical Type~Ibc SNe, proportional with the
stretch. Bolometric LC modeling and their nebular spectra indicate high ejecta
and nickel masses, assuming radioactive decay powering. Additionally, these
objects are preferentially located in low-metallicity host galaxies with high
star-formation rates, which may account for their massive progenitors, as well
as their relative absence from the literature. Our study thus supports the link
between broad LCs (as measured by stretch) and high-mass progenitor stars in
SE~SNe with independent evidence from bolometric LC modeling, nebular spectra,
host environment properties, and photometric evolution.
  In the first systematic search of its kind using an untargeted sample, we use
the stretch distribution to identify a higher than previously appreciated
fraction of SE~SNe with broad LCs (~13%). Correcting for Malmquist and LC
duration observational biases, we conservatively estimate that a minimum of ~6%
of SE~SNe are consistent with high-mass progenitors. This result has
implications for the progenitor channels of SE~SNe, late stages of massive
stellar evolution, oxygen fraction in the universe, and formation channels for
stellar-mass black holes.(Abridged)
