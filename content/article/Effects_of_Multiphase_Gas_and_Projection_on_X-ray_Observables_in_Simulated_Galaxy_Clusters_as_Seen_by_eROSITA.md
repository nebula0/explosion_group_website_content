 The number density of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift is a
sensitive function of the cosmological parameters. To use clusters for
cosmological parameter studies, it is necessary to determine their masses as
accurately as possible, which is typically done via mass-observable scaling
relations. X-ray observables can be biased by multiphase gas and projection
effects, especially in the case where cluster temperatures and luminosities are
estimated from single-model fits to all of the emission with a given radius.
Using simulated galaxy clusters from a realistic cosmological simulation, we
seek to determine the importance of these biases in the context of
Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA observations of clusters. We extract clusters
from the Magneticum suite, and simulate eROSITA observations of these clusters
using PHOX and SIXTE. We compare the fitted observables from these observations
to those derived from the simulations. We fitted an intrinsically scattered
$L_{\rm X}-T$ scaling relation to these measurements following a Bayesian
approach with which we fully took into account the selection effects and the
mass function. The largest biases on the cluster observables come from the
inadequacy of single-temperature model fits to represent emission from
multiphase gas, as well as a bias arising from cluster emission within the
projected $r_{500c}$ along the line of sight but outside of the spherical
$r_{500c}$. We find that the biases on temperature and luminosity due to the
projection of emission from other clusters within $r_{500c}$ is small. We find
that our simulated clusters follow a $L_{\rm X}-T$ scaling relation that has a
broadly consistent but slightly shallower slope compared to the literature, and
that the intrinsic scatter of $L_{\rm X}$ at given T is lower compared to the
recent observational results where the selection effects are fully considered.
