 For years, earth-based neutrino detectors have been run and operated to
detect the elusive neutrino. These have historically been enormous underground
detectors. The neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory ($\nu$SOL) project is working
to design a technical demonstration to show that a much smaller neutrino
detector can be operated in near-solar environments for a future spaceflight
mission. At a closest approach of 3 solar radii, there is a ten thousand-fold
increase in the neutrino flux. This would allow a 100 kg payload to be the
equivalent of a 1 kTon earth-based payload, larger than the first neutrino
experiment in the Homestake mine. As a continuing step towards this goal, the
$\nu$SOL project will fly a 3U CubeSat for testing the detector's passive
shielding design, active vetoing system in a space environment, and the rate of
false double-pulse signals in a space environment. I go into technical detail
about the characterization of the central detector in simuo and in the lab. The
first test is a characterization of energy resolution and calibration through
the use of radioactive sources. We will continue testing by measuring the veto
success rate with ground-level cosmic rays. For the final ground testing, we
will use the Fermilab test beam to characterize the central detector and veto
performance at specific particle energies. Veto performance on the previous
detector design has been promising, and we were able to veto a high percentage
of all particles that can penetrate the passive shielding of the satellite.
These laboratory results and simulations of the CubeSat detector design will
raise the technological readiness level of the planned technological
demonstrator flight to the sun, and the current level of shielding performance
is promising for a successful CubeSat test flight.
