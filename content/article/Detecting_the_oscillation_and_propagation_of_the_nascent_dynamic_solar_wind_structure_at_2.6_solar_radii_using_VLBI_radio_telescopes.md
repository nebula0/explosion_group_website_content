 Probing the solar corona is crucial to study the coronal heating and solar
wind acceleration. However, the transient and inhomogeneous solar wind flows
carry large-amplitude inherent Alfven waves and turbulence, which make
detection more difficult. We report the oscillation and propagation of the
solar wind at 2.6 solar radii (Rs) by observation of China Tianwen and ESA Mars
Express with radio telescopes. The observations were carried out on Oct.9 2021,
when one coronal mass ejection (CME) passed across the ray paths of the
telescope beams. We obtain the frequency fluctuations (FF) of the spacecraft
signals from each individual telescope. Firstly, we visually identify the drift
of the frequency spikes at a high spatial resolution of thousands of kilometers
along the projected baselines. They are used as traces to estimate the solar
wind velocity. Then we perform the cross-correlation analysis on the time
series of FF from different telescopes. The velocity variations of solar wind
structure along radial and tangential directions during the CME passage are
obtained. The oscillation of tangential velocity confirms the detection of
streamer wave. Moreover, at the tail of the CME, we detect the propagation of
an accelerating fast field-aligned density structure indicating the presence of
magnetohydrodynamic waves. This study confirm that the ground station-pairs are
able to form particular spatial projection baselines with high resolution and
sensitivity to study the detailed propagation of the nascent dynamic solar wind
structure.
