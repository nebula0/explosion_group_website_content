 SMACS~J0723.3-7327 is the first galaxy cluster lens observed by JWST. Based
on the ERO data from JWST, several groups have reported the results on strong
lensing analysis and mass distribution of this cluster. However, limited by the
angular coverage of the JWST data, the strong lensing models only cover the
central region. X-ray analysis on the hot ICM is necessary to obtain a more
complete constraint on the mass distribution in this very massive cluster. In
this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive X-ray analysis of J0723 to obtain
accurate ICM hydrostatic mass measurements, using the X-ray data from
SRG/eROSITA and Chandra X-ray observatories. By comparing the hydrostatic mass
profile with the strong lensing model, we aim to provide the most reliable
constraint on the distribution of mass up to R500. Thanks to the eROSITA
all-sky survey and Chandra data, which provide high S/N and high angular
resolution respectively, we are able to constrain the ICM gas density profile
and temperature profile with good accuracy both in the core and to the
outskirts. With the density and temperature profiles, we compute the
hydrostatic mass profile, which is then projected along the line of sight to
compare with the mass distribution obtained from the recent strong lensing
analysis based on JWST data. We also deproject the strong lensing mass
distribution using the hydrostatic mass profile we obtained in this work. The
X-ray results obtained from eROSITA and Chandra agree very well with each
other. The hydrostatic mass profiles we measured in this work, both projected
and deprojected, are in good agreement with recent strong lensing results based
on JWST data, at all radii.
