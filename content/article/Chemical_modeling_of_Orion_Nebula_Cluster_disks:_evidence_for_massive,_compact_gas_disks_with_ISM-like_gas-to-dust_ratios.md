 The stellar cluster environment is expected to play a central role in the
evolution of circumstellar disks. We use thermochemical modeling to constrain
the dust and gas masses, disk sizes, UV and X-ray radiation fields, viewing
geometries, and central stellar masses of 20 Class II disks in the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC). We fit a large grid of disk models to $350$ GHz continuum, CO
$J=3-2$, and HCO$^+$ $J=4-3$ ALMA observations of each target, and we introduce
a procedure for modeling interferometric observations of gas disks detected in
absorption against a bright molecular cloud background. We find that the ONC
disks are massive and compact, with typical radii $<100$ AU, gas masses
$\geq10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$, and gas-to-dust ratios $\geq100$. The ISM-like
gas-to-dust ratios derived from our modeling suggest that compact,
externally-irradiated disks in the ONC are less prone to gas-phase CO depletion
than the massive and extended gas disks that are commonly found in nearby
low-mass star-forming regions. The presence of massive gas disks indicates that
external photoevaporation may have only recently begun operating in the ONC,
though it remains unclear whether other cluster members are older and more
evaporated than the ones in our sample. Finally, we compare our
dynamically-derived stellar masses with the stellar masses predicted from
evolutionary models and find excellent agreement. Our study has significantly
increased the number of dynamical mass measurements in the mass range $\leq
0.5$ $M_{\odot}$, demonstrating that the ONC is an ideal region for obtaining
large samples of dynamical mass measurements towards low-mass M-dwarfs.
