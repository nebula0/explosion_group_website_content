 Several recent studies have shown that velocity differences of very wide
binary stars, measured to high precision with GAIA, can potentially provide an
interesting test for modified-gravity theories which attempt to emulate dark
matter; in essence, MOND-like theories (with external field effect included)
predict that wide binaries (wider than $\sim 7$ kAU) should orbit $\sim 15\%$
faster than Newtonian for similar orbit parameters; such a shift is readily
detectable in principle in the sample of 9,000 candidate systems selected from
GAIA EDR3 by Pittordis and Sutherland (2022). However, the main obstacle at
present is the observed ``fat tail" of candidate wide-binary systems with
velocity differences at $\sim 1.5 - 6 \times$ circular velocity; this tail
population cannot be bound pure binary systems, but is likely to be dominated
by triple or quadruple systems with unresolved or undetected additional
star(s).
  While this tail can be modelled and subtracted, obtaining an accurate model
for the triple population is crucial to obtain a robust test for modified
gravity. Here we explore prospects for observationally constraining the triple
population: we simulate a population of hierarchical triples ``observed" as in
PS22 at random epochs and viewing angles; then evaluate various possible
methods for detecting the third star, including GAIA astrometry, RV drift, and
several imaging methods from direct Rubin images, speckle imaging and
coronagraphic imaging. Results are encouraging, typically 90 percent of the
triple systems in the key regions of parameter space are detectable; there is a
moderate ``dead zone" of cool brown-dwarf companions at $\sim 25-100$ AU
separation which are not detectable with any of our baseline methods. A large
but feasible observing campaign can clarify the triple/quadruple population and
make the gravity test decisive.
