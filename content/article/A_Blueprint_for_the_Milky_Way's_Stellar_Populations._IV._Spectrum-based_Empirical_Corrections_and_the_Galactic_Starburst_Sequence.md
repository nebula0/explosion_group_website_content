 We continue our series of papers on phase-space distributions of stars in the
Milky Way based on photometrically derived metallicities and Gaia astrometry,
with a focus on the halo-disk interface in the local volume. To exploit various
photometric databases, we develop a method of empirically calibrating synthetic
stellar spectra based on a comparison with observations of stellar sequences
and individual stars in SDSS, SMSS, and PS1, overcoming band-specific
corrections employed in our previous work. In addition, photometric zero-point
corrections are derived to provide an internally consistent photometric system
with a spatially uniform metallicity zero point. Based on our phase-space
diagrams, we find a strikingly narrow sequence in the rotational velocity
($v_\phi$) versus metallicity ([Fe/H]) space for a sample of high proper-motion
stars ($>25$ mas yr$^{-1}$), which runs along the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus (GSE)
and the Splash sub-structures, and is connected to the disk. Notably, a rapid
increase of $v_\phi$ from a nearly zero net rotation to $200$ km s$^{-1}$
within a narrow metallicity interval ($-0.8 < {\rm [Fe/H]} < -0.2$) suggests
that these stars were formed on a short gas-depletion time scale. Based on
measurements of a scale height and length, we argue that they are distinct from
stars dynamically heated by mergers, and are the relics formed during the
starburst when the young Milky Way encountered the gas-rich GSE merger. The
chain of high proper-motion stars, which we dub the Galactic Starburst Sequence
(GSS), provides evidence that the post-merger metal-enriched gas settled onto
the disk.
