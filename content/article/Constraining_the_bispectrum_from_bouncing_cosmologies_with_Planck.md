 Bouncing models of cosmology, as they arise e.g. in loop quantum cosmology,
can generate close-to-scale-invariant fluctuation spectra as observed in the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, they are typically not Gaussian and
also generate a bispectrum. It was proposed that these models can help to
mitigate the large-scale anomalies of the CMB by considering large
non-Gaussianities on very large scales, which decay exponentially on
sub-horizon scales. It was therefore thought that this non-Gaussianity would
not be visible in observations, which can only probe sub-horizon scales. In
this letter we show that bouncing models with parameters such that they can
mitigate the large-scale anomalies of the CMB are excluded by the Planck data
with high significance of, depending on the specific model, $6.4$ or $14$
standard deviations.
