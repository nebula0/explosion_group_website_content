 Rotation may affect the occurrence of sustainable hydrogen burning in very
low-mass stellar objects by the introduction of centrifugal force to the
hydrostatic balance as well as by the appearance of rotational break-up of the
objects (mass-shedding limit) for rapidly rotating cases. We numerically
construct the models of rotating very low-mass stellar objects that may or may
not experience sustained nuclear reaction (hydrogen-burning) as their energy
source. The rotation is not limited to being slow so the effect of the
rotational deformation of them is not infinitesimally small. Critical curves of
sustainable hydrogen burning in the parameter space of mass versus central
degeneracy, on which the nuclear energy generation balances the surface
luminosity, are obtained for different values of angular momentum. It is shown
that if the angular momentum exceeds the threshold $J_0=8.85\times 10^{48}{\rm
erg}~{\rm s}$ the critical curve is broken up into two branches with lower and
higher degeneracy because of the mass-shedding limit. Based on the results, we
model mechano-thermal evolutions of substellar objects, in which cooling, as
well as mass/angular momentum reductions, are followed for two simplified
cases. The case with such external braking mechanisms as magnetized wind or
magnetic braking is mainly controlled by the spin-down timescale. The other
case with no external braking leads to the mass-shedding limit after
gravitational contraction. Thereafter the object sheds its mass to form a ring
or a disc surrounding it and shrinks.
