 AGN feedback during galaxy merger has been the most favoured model to explain
black hole-galaxy co-evolution. However, how the AGN-driven jet/wind/radiation
is coupled with the gas of the merging galaxies, which leads to positive
feedback, momentarily enhanced star formation, and subsequently negative
feedback, a decline in star formation, is poorly understood. Only a few cases
are known where the jet and companion galaxy interaction leads to minor
off-axis distortions in the jets and enhanced star formation in the gas-rich
minor companions. Here, we briefly report one extraordinary case, RAD12,
discovered by RAD@home citizen science collaboratory, where for the first time
a radio jet-driven bubble ~137 kpc is showing a symmetric reflection after
hitting the incoming galaxy which is not a gas-rich minor but a gas-poor
early-type galaxy in a major merger. Surprisingly, neither positive feedback
nor any radio lobe on the counter jet side, if any, is detected. It is puzzling
if RAD12 is a genuine one-sided jet or a case of radio lobe trapped, compressed
and re-accelerated by shocks during the merger. This is the first imaging study
of RAD12 presenting follow-up with the GMRT, archival MeerKAT radio data and
CFHT optical data.
