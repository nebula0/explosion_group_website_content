 Images obtained with single-conjugate adaptive optics (AO) show spatial
variation of the point spread function (PSF) due to both atmospheric
anisoplanatism and instrumental aberrations. The poor knowledge of the PSF
across the field of view strongly impacts the ability to take full advantage of
AO capabilities. The AIROPA project aims to model these PSF variations for the
NIRC2 imager at the Keck Observatory. Here, we present the characterization of
the instrumental phase aberrations over the entire NIRC2 field of view and we
present a new metric for quantifying the quality of the calibration, the
fraction of variance unexplained (FVU). We used phase diversity measurements
obtained on an artificial light source to characterize the variation of the
aberrations across the field of view and their evolution with time. We find
that there is a daily variation of the wavefront error (RMS of the residuals is
94~nm) common to the whole detector, but the differential aberrations across
the field of view are very stable (RMS of the residuals between different
epochs is 59~nm). This means that instrumental calibrations need to be
monitored often only at the center of the detector, and the much more
time-consuming variations across the field of view can be characterized less
frequently (most likely when hardware upgrades happen). Furthermore, we tested
AIROPA's instrumental model through real data of the fiber images on the
detector. We find that modeling the PSF variations across the field of view
improves the FVU metric by 60\% and reduces the detection of fake sources by
70\%.
