 We present the results of our study of starforming regions in the lenticular
galaxy NGC 4324. During a complex analysis of multiwavelength observational
data -- the narrow-band emission-line images obtained with the 2.5-m telescope
at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of
the Moscow State University and the archival images in the broad bands of the
SDSS, GALEX and WISE surveys -- we have detected young starforming complexes
(clumps) located in the inner ring of the lenticular galaxy NGC 4324, and we
have established a regular pattern of their distribution along the ring, which,
nevertheless, changes with time (with age of starforming regions). We suggest
several possible evolutionary paths of the lenticular galaxy NGC 4324, of which
the accretion of gas-rich satellites or giant clouds (the so-called minor
merging) is the most probable one.
