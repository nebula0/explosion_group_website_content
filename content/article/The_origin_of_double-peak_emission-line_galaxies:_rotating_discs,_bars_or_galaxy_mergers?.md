 Emission lines with a double-peak (DP) shape, detected in the centre of
galaxies, have been extensively used in the past to identify peculiar
kinematics such as dual active galactic nuclei, outflows or mergers. From a
large DP galaxy sample, a connection to minor merger galaxies with ongoing star
formation was suggested. To gain a better understanding of different mechanisms
creating a DP signature, we here explore synthetic SDSS spectroscopic
observations computed from disc models and simulations. We show how a DP
signature is connected to the central part of the rotation curve of galaxies,
which is mostly shaped by the stellar bulge. We, furthermore, find that bars
can create strong DP emission-line signatures when viewed along their major
axis. Major mergers can form a central rotating disc in late post-coalescence
merger stages (1\,Gyr after the final coalescence), which creates a DP
signature. Minor mergers tend to show a DP feature with no correlation to the
galaxy inclination within 350\,Myr after the final coalescence. Comparisons of
these scenarii with observations disfavour major mergers, since these show
predominantly elliptical and only a few S0 morphologies. Furthermore, at such a
late merger stage the enhanced star formation is most likely faded. Bars and
minor mergers, on the other hand, can be compared quite well with the
observations. Both observations coincide with increased star formation found in
observations, and minor mergers in particular do not show any dependency with
the observation direction. However, observations resolving the galaxy
kinematics spatially are needed to distinguish between the discussed
possibilities. More insight into the origin of DP will be gained by a broader
comparison with cosmological simulations. The understanding of the DP origin
can provide important tools to study the mass growth of galaxies in future high
redshift surveys.
