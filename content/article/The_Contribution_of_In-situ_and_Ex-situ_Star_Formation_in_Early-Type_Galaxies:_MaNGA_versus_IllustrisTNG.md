 We compare stellar mass surface density, metallicity, age, and line-of-sight
velocity dispersion profiles in massive ($M_*\geq10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$)
present-day early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the MaNGA survey with simulated
galaxies from the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG suite. We find an
excellent agreement between the stellar mass surface density profiles of MaNGA
and TNG100 ETGs, both in shape and normalisation. Moreover, TNG100 reproduces
the shapes of the profiles of stellar metallicity and age, as well as the
normalisation of velocity dispersion distributions of MaNGA ETGs. We generally
also find good agreement when comparing the stellar profiles of central and
satellite galaxies between MaNGA and TNG100. An exception is the velocity
dispersion profiles of very massive ($M_*\gtrsim10^{11.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$)
central galaxies, which, on average, are significantly higher in TNG100 than in
MaNGA ($\approx50\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$). We study the radial profiles of
$\mathit{in}$-$\mathit{situ}$ and $\mathit{ex}$-$\mathit{situ}$ stars in TNG100
and discuss the extent to which each population contributes to the observed
MaNGA profiles. Our analysis lends significant support to the idea that
high-mass ($M_*\gtrsim10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) ETGs in the present-day
Universe are the result of a merger-driven evolution marked by major mergers
that tend to homogenise the stellar populations of the progenitors in the
merger remnant.
