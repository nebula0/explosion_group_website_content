 The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E $> 10^{18}$ eV) is one
of the great mysteries of modern astrophysics. It has been suggested that
UHECRs could be accelerated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and engine-driven
supernovae (SNe). Here we report the discovery of a 1.4 teraelectronvolt (TeV)
photon offset 0.97$^{\circ}$ from the site of the nearby (36.9 megaparsecs) GRB
980425/SN 1998bw explosion. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the TeV emission on 17 November 2018, more
than 20 years after the original GRB 980425/SN 1998bw trigger. TeV detections
at high Galactic latitudes by the LAT are extremely rare, with an average of 6
events per year. We propose that the delayed TeV emission is consistent with
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and/or electron-positron pairs from GRB 980425/SN
1998bw being deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) and
subsequently cascading into secondary gamma rays. Based on the arrival time
delay of the TeV emission, we estimate an IGMF strength of order $B \simeq
10^{-12}$-$10^{-13}$ Gauss. This result supports the possibility of UHECR
acceleration in GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and suggests that most detected UHECRs are
produced in local GRB/SNe within 200 Mpc. In addition, secondary photons from
UHECRs out to 0.9-31 Gpc may also offer an explanation for extragalactic
background photons with energies $\geq 1$ TeV detected by the Fermi LAT.
