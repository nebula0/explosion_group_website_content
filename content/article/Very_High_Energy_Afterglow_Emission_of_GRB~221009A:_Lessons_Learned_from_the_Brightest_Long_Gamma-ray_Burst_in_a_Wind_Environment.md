 In this paper, we modeled the dynamics and radiation physics of the rarity
event GRB 221009A afterglow in detail. Based on the analysis results of the
{\tt ASGARD} package we developed, the afterglow data of GRB 221009A strongly
favors the origin of a relativistic jet propagating in a stellar-wind-dominated
environment. Therefore, GRB 221009A is a typical lesson for the very high
energy (VHE) afterglow of long gamma-ray burst in a wind environment. We also
show the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis results of GRB
221009A, and find that the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation component
of GRB 221009A is very bright in the $0.1-10$ TeV band. The integrated SED of
$0-2000$ s after {\em Fermi}/GBM trigger shows that the bright SSC component
can be easily observed in TeV band, above the detection sensitivity of LHASSO,
MAGIC and CTA. We predict that the SSC radiation peak flux of GRB 221009A in
the first 2000 second integral SED is $\sim 10^{-7}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$,
with a peak energy close to 300 GeV. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of
GeV observations could break the degeneracy between model parameters,
highlighting the significance of high-energy observations in determining
accurate parameters for GRB afterglows.
