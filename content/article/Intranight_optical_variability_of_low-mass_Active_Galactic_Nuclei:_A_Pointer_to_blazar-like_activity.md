 This study aims to characterise, for the first time, intranight optical
variability (INOV) of low-mass active galactic nuclei (LMAGN) which host a
black hole (BH) of mass $M_{BH} \sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$, i.e., even less massive
than the Galactic centre black hole Sgr A* and 2-3 orders of magnitude below
the supermassive black holes (SMBH, $M_{BH}$ $\sim$ $10^8 - 10^9 M_{\odot}$)
which are believed to power quasars. Thus, LMAGN are a crucial subclass of AGN
filling the wide gap between SMBH and stellar-mass BHs of Galactic X-ray
binaries. We have carried out a 36-session campaign of intranight optical
monitoring of a well-defined, representative sample of 12 LMAGNs already
detected in X-ray and radio bands. This set of LMAGN is found to exhibit INOV
at a level statistically comparable to that observed for blazars (M$_{BH}
\gtrsim$ 10$^{8-9}$ M$_{\odot}$) and for the $\gamma$-ray detected Narrow-line
Seyfert1 galaxies (M$_{BH}\sim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$) which, too, are believed to
have relativistic jets. This indicates that the blazar-level activity can even
be sustained by central engines with black holes near the upper limit for
Intermediate Mass Black Holes ($M_{BH}$ $\sim$ $10^3 - 10^6 M_{\odot}$).
