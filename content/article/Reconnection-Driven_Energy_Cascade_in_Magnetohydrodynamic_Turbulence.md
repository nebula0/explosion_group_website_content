 Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence regulates the transfer of energy from large to
small scales in many astrophysical systems, including the solar atmosphere. We
perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations with unprecedentedly
large magnetic Reynolds number to reveal how rapid reconnection of magnetic
field lines changes the classical paradigm of the turbulent energy cascade. By
breaking elongated current sheets into chains of small magnetic flux ropes (or
plasmoids), magnetic reconnection leads to a new range of turbulent energy
cascade, where the rate of energy transfer is controlled by the growth rate of
the plasmoids. As a consequence, the turbulent energy spectra steepen and
attain a spectral index of -2.2 that is accompanied by changes in the
anisotropy of turbulence eddies. The omnipresence of plasmoids and their
consequences on, e.g., solar coronal heating, can be further explored with
current and future spacecraft and telescopes.
