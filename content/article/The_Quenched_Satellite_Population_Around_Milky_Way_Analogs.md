 We study the relative fractions of quenched and star-forming satellite
galaxies in the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) survey and
Exploration of Local VolumE Satellites (ELVES) program, two nearby and
complementary samples of Milky Way-like galaxies that take different approaches
to identify faint satellite galaxy populations. We cross-check and validate
sample cuts and selection criteria, as well as explore the effects of different
star-formation definitions when determining the quenched satellite fraction of
Milky Way analogs. We find the mean ELVES quenched fraction ($\langle
QF\rangle$), derived using a specific star formation rate (sSFR) threshold,
decreases from $\sim$50% to $\sim$27% after applying a cut in absolute
magnitude to match that of the SAGA survey ($\langle QF\rangle_{SAGA}\sim$9%).
We show these results are consistent for alternative star-formation
definitions. Furthermore, these quenched fractions remain virtually unchanged
after applying an additional cut in surface brightness. Using a
consistently-derived sSFR and absolute magnitude limit for both samples, we
show that the quenched fraction and the cumulative number of satellites in the
ELVES and SAGA samples broadly agree. We briefly explore radial trends in the
ELVES and SAGA samples, finding general agreement in the number of star-forming
satellites per host as a function of radius. Despite the broad agreement
between the ELVES and SAGA samples, some tension remains with these quenched
fractions in comparison to the Local Group and simulations of Milky Way
analogs.
