 Motivated by the increasing number of gravitational wave detections of
merging black holes (BHs) by LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA, BH binary mergers in the discs
of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is investigated as a possible merger channel.
In this pathway, BHs in the large gas disc are expected to encounter one
another, become mutually bound as a BH binary system through interaction with
the gas in the disc and subsequently inspiral through gravitational torques
induced by the local gas until merger. To more precisely determine the
feasibility of this merger pathway, we present the first 3D global hydrodynamic
simulations of both the formation and evolution of a stellar-mass BH binaries
AGN discs with three different AGN disc masses and five different initial
radial separations. These 15 different simulations show that binary capture can
be successful in a range of local gas densities including cases well below that
of a standard radiatively efficient alpha disc, and identify that the majority
of these captured binaries are then subsequently hardened by the surrounding
gas. Both prograde and retrograde binaries are formed in our simulations, which
tend to be slowly hardened by the gas. The eccentricity evolution is found to
depend strongly on the orbital rotation of the binary where prograde binaries
are governed by gravitational torques form their circumbinary mini-disc, with
eccentricities being damped over time, while for retrograde binaries the
eccentricities are excited to >0.9 by accretion torques. In two cases,
retrograde binaries ultimately undergo a close periapsis passage which results
in a merger via gravitational waves after only a few thousand binary orbits.
Thus, the merger timescale for retrograde binaries can be far shorter than the
lifetime of an AGN disc. These simulations support the case that the AGN merger
pathway could be highly efficient for merging BHs.
