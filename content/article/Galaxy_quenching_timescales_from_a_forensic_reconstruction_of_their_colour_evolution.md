 The timescales on which galaxies move out of the blue cloud to the red
sequence ($\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$) provide insight into the mechanisms driving
quenching. Here, we build upon previous work, where we showcased a method to
reconstruct the colour evolution of observed low-redshift galaxies from the
Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey based on spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting with ProSpect, together with a statistically-driven definition
for the blue and red populations. We also use the predicted colour evolution
from the SHARK semi-analytic model, combined with SED fits of our simulated
galaxy sample, to study the accuracy of the measured $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$ and
gain physical insight into the colour evolution of galaxies. In this work, we
measure $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$ in a consistent approach for both observations and
simulations. After accounting for selection bias, we find evidence for an
increase in $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$ in GAMA as a function of cosmic time (from
$\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}\sim1$ Gyr to $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}\sim2$ Gyr in the lapse of
$\sim4$ Gyr), but not in SHARK ($\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}\lesssim1$ Gyr). Our
observations and simulations disagree on the effect of stellar mass, with GAMA
showing massive galaxies transitioning faster, but is the opposite in SHARK. We
find that environment only impacts galaxies below $\sim10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ in
GAMA, with satellites having shorter $\tau^{}_\mathrm{Q}$ than centrals by
$\sim0.4$ Gyr, with SHARK only in qualitative agreement. Finally, we compare to
previous literature, finding consistency with timescales in the order of couple
Gyr, but with several differences that we discuss.
