 Deriving oxygen abundances from the electron temperature (hereafter the
$T_e$-method) is the gold-standard for extragalactic metallicity studies.
However, unresolved temperature fluctuations in HII regions can bias
metallicity estimates low, with a magnitude that depends on the underlying and
typically unknown temperature distribution. Using a toy model, we confirm that
computing $T_e$-based metallicities using the temperature derived from the [O
III] $\lambda$4363/$\lambda$5007 ratio ('ratio temperature'; $T_{\rm ratio}$)
results in an underprediction of metallicity when temperature fluctuations are
present. In contrast, using the unobservable 'line temperatures' ($T_{\rm
line}$) that provide the mean electron and ion density-weighted emissivity
yield an accurate metallicity estimate. To correct this bias, we demonstrate an
example calibration of a relation between $T_{\rm ratio}$ and $T_{\rm line}$
based on a high-resolution (4.5 pc) RAMSES-RTZ simulation of a dwarf galaxy
that self-consistently models the formation of multiple HII regions and ion
temperature distribution in a galactic context. Applying this correction to the
low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation shifts its normalization up by
0.18 dex on average and flattens its slope from 0.87 to 0.58, highlighting the
need for future studies to account for, and correct, this bias.
