 In this work, we consider an interacting dark-fluid cosmological model in
which energy exchange between dark matter and dark energy occurs through
diffusion. After solving the background expansion history for a late-time
universe, we attempt to constrain the cosmological parameters by comparing
simulated values of the model against Supernovae Type 1A data. We consider four
different cases and compare them against the LCDM model as the "true model".
Our results show that the diffusive model in which dark energy flows to dark
matter is the most likely alternative to LCDM model. This model is not only in
line with Planck 2018 observational results but can also give a potential
explanation to the so-called Hubble tension.
