 Recent observations show that the metallicity of the broad line region
($Z_{\rm BLR}$) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is solar-to-supersolar, which
is positively correlated with the mass of supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm
BH}$) and does not evolve with redshift up to $z \sim 7$. We revisit the
$M_{\rm BH}-Z_{\rm BLR}$ correlation with more AGNs with $M_{\rm BH}\sim
10^{6-8} M_{\odot}$ and find that the positive correlation become flat in
low-mass range. It is known that outer part of accretion disks is
gravitationally unstable and can fragment into stars. Considering the star
formation and supernovae (SNe) in the outer AGN disk, we calculate the metal
enrichment and find that positive $M_{\rm BH}-Z_{\rm BLR}$ correlation can be
roughly reproduced if the stellar mass distribution is ``top-heavy". We find
that the observed BLR size is more or less similar to the self-gravity radius
of the AGN disk, which suggests that the BLR may be closely correlated with the
underlying accretion process.
