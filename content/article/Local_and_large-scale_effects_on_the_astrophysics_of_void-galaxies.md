 Galaxies in cosmic voids have been reported with properties related to a
delayed evolution with respect to the Universe in general. These
characteristics reflect the interaction of galaxies with the environment.
However, it is not clear the degree of influence of the large-scale structure
on the properties of void galaxies or, if these are only influenced by the low
local density around them typical of these regions. In this article we
identified cosmic voids in the SDSS-DR16 and studied various properties of
galaxies, such as g-r colour, star formation rate, and concentration. To
characterise the local environment, we have identified groups of galaxies and
studied their properties as a function of their dark matter and stellar masses,
analysing separately those found in voids and in the general sample. Our
results show that galaxies that inhabit haloes of a given mass (below \sim
10^13.5 M_\dot ), are bluer, have a higher star formation rate and are less
concentrated when the host halo is inside voids compared to other regions. For
larger halo masses, the trend disappears. We also analyse whether the
properties of galaxies are sensitive to the type of voids that inhabit. This is
done by separating voids embedded in overdense regions (S-type) from those that
asymptotically converge to the average density of the universe (R-type). We
found that galaxies in R-type voids are bluer, with higher SFR and less
concentration than in S-type voids. Our results indicate some degree of
correlation of galaxy properties with the large-scale environment provided by
voids, suggesting possible second-order mechanisms in galaxy evolution.
