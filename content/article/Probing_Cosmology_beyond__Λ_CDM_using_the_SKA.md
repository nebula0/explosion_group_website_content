 The cosmological principle states that the Universe is statistically
homogeneous and isotropic at large distance scales. There currently exist many
observations which indicate a departure from this principle. It has been shown
that many of these observations can be explained by invoking superhorizon
cosmological perturbations and may be consistent with the Big Bang paradigm.
Remarkably, these modes simultaneously explain the observed Hubble tension,
i.e., the discrepancy between the direct and indirect measurements of the
Hubble parameter. We propose several tests of the cosmological principle using
SKA. In particular, we can reliably extract the signal of dipole anisotropy in
the distribution of radio galaxies. The superhorizon perturbations also predict
a significant redshift dependence of the dipole signal which can be nicely
tested by the study of signals of reionization and the dark ages using SKA. We
also propose to study the alignment of radio galaxy axes as well as their
integrated polarization vectors over distance scales ranging from a few Mpc to
Gpc. We discuss data analysis techniques that can reliably extract these
signals from data.
