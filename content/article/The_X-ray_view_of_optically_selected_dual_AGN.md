 We present a study of optically selected dual AGN with projected separations
of 3--97~kpc. Using multi-wavelength (MWL) information (optical, X-rays,
mid-IR), we characterized the intrinsic nuclear properties of this sample and
compared them with those of isolated systems. Among the 124 X-ray detected AGN
candidates, 52 appear in pairs and 72 as single X-ray sources. Through MWL
analysis, we confirmed the presence of the AGN in a fraction >80\% of the
detected targets in pairs (42 over 52). X-ray spectral analysis confirms the
trend of increasing AGN luminosity with decreasing separation, suggesting that
mergers may have contributed in triggering more luminous AGN. Through X/mid-IR
ratio $vs$ X-ray colors, we estimated a fraction of Compton-thin AGN (with
10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $<$ N$_{\rm H} <$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) of about 80\%, while
about 16\% are Compton thick (CT, with N$_{\rm H}>$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$)
sources. These fractions of obscured sources are larger than those found in
samples of isolated AGN, confirming that pairs of AGN show higher obscuration.
This trend is further confirmed by comparing the de-reddened [O\ III] emission
with the observed X-ray luminosity. However, the derived fraction of
Compton-thick sources in this sample at early stage of merging is lower than
reported for late-merging dual-AGN samples. Comparing N$_{\rm H}$ from X-rays
with that derived from E(B-V) from Narrow Line Regions, we find that the
absorbing material is likely associated with the torus or the Broad Line
Regions. We also explored the X-ray detection efficiency of dual-AGN
candidates, finding that, when observed properly (at on-axis positions and with
long exposures), X-ray data represent a powerful way to confirm and investigate
dual-AGN systems.
