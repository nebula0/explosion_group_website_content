 We present 230 GHz continuum polarization observations with the Atacama Large
Milimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) at a resolution of 0$\farcs1$ ($\sim
540$~au) in the high-mass star-forming regions W51 e2 and e8. These
observations resolve a network of core-connecting dust lanes, marking a
departure from earlier coarser more spherical continuum structures. At the same
time, the cores do not appear to fragment further. Polarized dust emission is
clearly detected. The inferred magnetic field orientations are prevailingly
parallel to dust lanes. This key structural feature is analyzed together with
the local gravitational vector field. The direction of local gravity is found
to typically align with dust lanes. With these findings we derive a stability
criterion that defines a maximum magnetic field strength that can be overcome
by an observed magnetic field-gravity configuration. Equivalently, this defines
a minimum field strength that can stabilize dust lanes against a radial
collapse. We find that the detected dust lanes in W51 e2 and e8 are stable,
hence possibly making them a fundamental component in the accretion onto
central sources, providing support for massive star formation models without
the need of large accretion disks. When comparing to coarser resolutions,
covering the scales of envelope, global, and local collapse, we find recurring
similarities in the magnetic field structures and their corresponding
gravitational vector fields. These self-similar structures point at a
multi-scale collapse-within-collapse scenario until finally the scale of
core-accreting dust lanes is reached where gravity is entraining the magnetic
field and aligning it with the dust lanes.
