 We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including
time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary,
and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics can impact
stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration,
and the evolution of (super)massive black-hole binaries. We discuss the
dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with
recent observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary
accretion involves binaries embedded in "big" disks, which may contribute to
the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include:
  $\bullet$ Circumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at
$P_{\rm b}$ (the binary period) or $\sim 5P_{\rm p}$, depending on the binary
eccentricity $e_{\rm b}$ and mass ratio $q_{\rm b}$.
  $\bullet$ The inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent
eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical
processes (e.g. planet migration) taking place in the disk.
  $\bullet$ Over long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward
equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay, as is
commonly assumed. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary
parameters ($e_{\rm b}$ and $q_{\rm b}$), and on the thermodynamic properties
of the accreting gas.
  $\bullet$ A misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve
toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when $e_{\rm b}$ is
significant, the disk can evolve toward "polar alignment", with the disk plane
perpendicular to the binary plane.
