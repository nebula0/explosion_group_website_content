 In this paper we present CALSAGOS: Clustering ALgorithmS Applied to Galaxies
in Overdense Systems which is a PYTHON package developed to select cluster
members and to search, find, and identify substructures. CALSAGOS is based on
clustering algorithms and was developed to be used in spectroscopic and
photometric samples. To test the performance of CALSAGOS we use the S-PLUS's
mock catalogues and we found an error of 1\% - 6\% on member selection
depending on the function that is used. Besides, CALSAGOS has a $F_1$-score of
0.8, a precision of 85\% and a completeness of 100\% in the identification of
substructures in the outer regions of galaxy clusters ($r > r_{200}$). The
$F_1$-score, precision and completeness of CALSAGOS fall to 0.5, 75\% and 40\%
when we consider all substructure identifications (inner and outer) due to the
function that searches, finds, and identifies the substructures works in 2D and
cannot resolve the substructures projected over others.
