 Known as the "Missing Baryon Problem", about one-third of baryons in the
local universe remain unaccounted for. The missing baryons are thought to
reside in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) of the cosmic web filaments,
which are challenging to detect. Recent Chandra X-ray observations from
Kov\'acs et al. (2019) used a novel stacking analysis and detected an OVII
absorption line toward the sightline of a luminous quasar, hinting that the
missing baryons may reside in the WHIM. To explore how the properties of the
OVII absorption line depend on feedback physics, we compare the observational
results with predictions obtained from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with
MachinE Learning (CAMEL) Simulation suite. CAMELS consists of cosmological
simulations with state-of-the-art supernova (SN) and active galactic nuclei
(AGN) feedback models from the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations, with varying
strengths. We find that the simulated OVII column densities are higher in the
outskirts of galaxies than in the large-scale WHIM, but they are consistently
lower than those obtained in the Chandra observations, for all feedback runs.
We establish that the OVII distribution is primarily sensitive to changes in
the SN feedback prescription, whereas changes in the AGN feedback prescription
have minimal impact. We also find significant differences in the OVII column
densities between the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA runs. We conclude that the tension
between the observed and simulated OVII column densities cannot be explained by
the wide range of feedback models implemented in CAMELS.
