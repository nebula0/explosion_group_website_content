 Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are possible candidates for explaining the
observed magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Two competing scenarios of
primordial magnetogenesis have been discussed in the literature: inflationary
and phase-transitional. We study the amplification of both large- and
small-scale correlated magnetic fields corresponding to inflation- and
phase-transition-generated PMFs in a massive galaxy cluster. We employ
high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations to resolve
turbulent motions in the intracluster medium. We find that the turbulent
amplification is more efficient for the large-scale, inflationary models while
the phase-transition-generated seed fields show moderate growth. The
differences between the models are imprinted on the spectral characteristics of
the field (such as amplitude and shape of the magnetic power spectrum) and
therewith on the final correlation length. We find one order of magnitude
difference in the final strengths between the inflation- and
phase-transition-generated magnetic field and a factor of $1.5$ difference in
their final coherence scales. Thus, the final configuration of the magnetic
field retains information on the PMF generation scenarios. Our findings have
implications for future extragalactic Faraday rotation surveys with the
possibility of distinguishing between different magnetogenesis scenarios.
