 We present X-ray spectral analysis of XMM and Chandra observations in the
31.3 deg$^2$ Stripe-82X (S82X) field. Of the 6181 unique X-ray sources in this
field, we select and analyze a sample of 2937 candidate active galactic nuclei
(AGN) with solid redshifts and sufficient counts determined by simulations. Our
results show an observed population with median values of spectral index
$\Gamma=1.94_{-0.39}^{+0.31}$, column density log
$N_H/\rm{cm}^{-2}=20.7_{-0.5}^{+1.2}$ ($21.6_{-0.9}^{+0.7}$ considering upper
limits) and intrinsic, de-absorbed, 2-10 keV luminosity log
$L_X/\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}=44.0_{-1.0}^{+0.7}$, in the redshift range 0-4.
Correcting for observational biases, we derive the intrinsic,
model-independent, fraction of AGN that are obscured
($22\leq\rm{log}\,N_H/\rm{cm}^{-2}<24$), finding a significant increase in the
obscured AGN fraction with redshift and a decline with increasing luminosity.
The average obscured AGN fraction is $57\pm4\%$ for log
$L_X/\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}>43$. This work constrains the AGN obscuration and
spectral shape of the still uncertain high-luminosity and high-redshift regimes
(log $L_X/\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}>45.5$, $z>3$), where the obscured AGN fraction rises
to $64\pm12\%$. The total, obscured, and unobscured X-ray luminosity functions
(XLFs) are determined out to $z=4$. We report a luminosity and density
evolution of the total XLF, with obscured AGN dominating at all luminosities at
$z>2$ and unobscured sources prevailing at log $L_X/\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}>45$ at
lower redshifts. Our results agree with the evolutionary models in which the
bulk of AGN activity is triggered by gas-rich environments and in a downsizing
scenario. Also, the black hole accretion density is found to evolve similarly
to the star formation rate density, confirming the co-evolution scenario
between AGN and host galaxy, but suggesting different time scales in their
growing history.
