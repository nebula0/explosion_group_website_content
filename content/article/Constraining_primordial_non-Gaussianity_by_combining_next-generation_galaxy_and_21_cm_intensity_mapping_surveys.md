 Surveys of the matter distribution contain `fossil' information on possible
non-Gaussianity that is generated in the primordial Universe. This primordial
signal survives only on the largest scales where cosmic variance is strongest.
By combining different surveys in a multi-tracer approach, we can suppress the
cosmic variance and significantly improve the precision on the level of
primordial non-Gaussianity. We consider a combination of an optical galaxy
survey, like the recently initiated DESI survey, together with a new and very
different type of survey, a 21 cm intensity mapping survey, like the upcoming
SKAO survey. A Fisher forecast of the precision on the local primordial
non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, shows that this multi-tracer
combination, together with non-overlap single-tracer information, can deliver
precision comparable to that from the CMB. Taking account of the largest
systematic, i.e. foreground contamination in intensity mapping, we find that
$\sigma(f_{\mathrm{NL}}) \sim 3$.
