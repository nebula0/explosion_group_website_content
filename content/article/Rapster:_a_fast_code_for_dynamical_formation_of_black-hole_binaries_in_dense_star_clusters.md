 Gravitational-wave observations have just started probing the properties of
black-hole binary merger populations. The observation of binaries with very
massive black holes and small mass ratios motivates the study of dense star
clusters as astrophysical environments which can produce such events
dynamically. In this paper we present Rapster (for "Rapid cluster evolution"),
a new code designed to rapidly model binary black hole population synthesis and
the evolution of star clusters based on simple, yet realistic prescriptions.
The code can be used to generate large populations of dynamically formed binary
black holes. It makes use of existing packages such as SEVN to model the
initial black hole mass spectrum, and PRECESSION to model the mass, spin and
gravitational recoil of merger remnants. We demonstrate that the event rates
and population properties predicted by Rapster are in good agreement with other
state-of-the-art codes.
