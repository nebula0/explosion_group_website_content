 We evolve two high-resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) simulations of advection-dominated accretion flows around non-spinning
black holes (BHs), each over a duration $\sim 3\times 10^5\,GM_{\rm BH}/c^3$.
One model captures the evolution of a weakly magnetized (SANE) disk and the
other a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Magnetic flux eruptions in the MAD
model push out gas from the disk and launch strong winds with outflow
efficiencies at times reaching $10\%$ of the incoming accretion power. Despite
the substantial power in these winds, average mass outflow rates remain small
out to a radius $\sim100\,GM_{\rm BH}/c^2$, only reaching $\sim 60-80\%$ of the
horizon accretion rate. The average outward angular momentum transport is
primarily radial in both modes of accretion, but with a clear distinction:
magnetic flux eruption-driven disk winds cause a strong vertical flow of
angular momentum in the MAD model, while for the SANE model, the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) moves angular momentum mostly equatorially
through the disk. Further, we find that the MAD state is highly transitory and
non-axisymmetric, with the accretion mode often changing to a SANE-like state
following an eruption before reattaining magnetic flux saturation with time.
The Reynolds stress changes direction during such transitions, with the MAD
(SANE) state showing an inward (outward) stress, possibly pointing to
intermittent MRI-driven accretion in MADs. Pinning down the nature of flux
eruptions using next-generation telescopes will be crucial in understanding the
flow of mass, magnetic flux and angular momentum in sub-Eddington accreting BHs
like M87$^*$ and Sagittarius A$^*$.
