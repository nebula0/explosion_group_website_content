 Precise measurements of the boron-to-carbon and boron-to-oxygen ratios by
DAMPE show clear hardenings around $100$ GeV/n, which provide important
implications on the production, propagation, and interaction of Galactic cosmic
rays. In this work we investigate a number of models proposed in literature in
light of the DAMPE findings. These models can roughly be classified into two
classes, the propagation effect and the source effect. Among these models
discussed, we find that the re-acceleration of cosmic rays during their
propagation by random magnetohydrodynamic waves may not reproduce significant
enough hardenings of B/C and B/O, and an additional spectral break of the
diffusion coefficient is required. The other models can properly explain the
hardenings of the ratios. However, depending on simplifications assumed, the
models differ in their quality in reproducing the data in a wide energy range.
The models with significant re-acceleration effect will under-predict
low-energy antiprotons but over-predict low-energy positrons, and the models
with secondary production at sources over-predict high-energy antiprotons. For
all models high-energy positron excess exists.
