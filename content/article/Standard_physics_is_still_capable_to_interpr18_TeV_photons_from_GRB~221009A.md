 It is reported that the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO)
observed thousands of very-high-energy photons up to $\sim$18 TeV from GRB
221009A. We study the survival rate of these photons by considering the fact
that they are absorbed by the extragalactic background light. By performing a
set of $10^6$ Monte-Carlo simulations, we explore the parameter space allowed
by current observations and find that the probability of predicting that LHAASO
observes at least one photons of 18 TeV from GRB 221009A within 2000 seconds is
4--5\%. Hence, it is still possible for the standard physics to interpret
LHAASO's observation in the energy range of several TeV. Our method can be
straightforwardly generalized to study more data sets of LHAASO and other
experiments in the future.
