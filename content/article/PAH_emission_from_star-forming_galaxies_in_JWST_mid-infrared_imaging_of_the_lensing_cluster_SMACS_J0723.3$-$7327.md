 The mid-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are characterized by
characteristic broad PAH emission features at 3$-$20 $\mu$m. As these features
are redshifted, they are predicted to dominate the flux at specific
mid-infrared wavelengths, leading to substantial redshift-dependent color
variations in broad-band photometry. The advent of JWST for the first time
allows the study of this effect for normal SFGs. Based on spectral energy
distribution templates, we here present tracks in mid-infrared (4.4, 7.7, 10,
15, and 18 $\mu$m) color-color diagrams describing the redshift dependence of
SFG colors. In addition, we present simulated color-color diagrams by
populating these tracks using the cosmic star-formation history and the
star-formation rate function. Depending on redshift, we find that SFGs stand
out in the color-color diagrams by several magnitudes. We provide the first
observational demonstration of this effect for galaxies detected in the JWST
Early Release Observations of the field towards the lensing cluster SMACS
J0723.3$-$7327. While the distribution of detected galaxies is consistent with
the simulations, the numbers are substantially boosted by lensing effects. The
PAH emitter with the highest spectroscopic redshift, detected in all bands, is
a multiply-imaged galaxy at $z=1.45$. There is also a substantial number of
cluster members, which do not exhibit PAH emission, except for one Seyfert
galaxy at $z=0.38$. Future wider-field observations will further populate
mid-infrared color-color diagrams and provide insight into the evolution of
typical SFGs.
