 We study ejection mechanisms for two kinds of steady jets: one observed from
black hole binaries in the low/hard state and the other from SS433. The
specific energy of the ejected gas is required to be positive for the jets to
get to infinity, while that of the accreted gas is naively considered to be
negative at the outermost boundary of the accretion flow. To reconcile the
opposite sign of the specific energies, we propose a situation where two layers
exist in the accretion flow and one layer receives energy from the other
sufficiently for the specific energy to be positive. For the steady jets in the
low/hard state, the accretion ring at the outermost end of the accretion flow
is considered to yield two-layer flow in which a geometrically thick ADAF
sandwiches a geometrically thin accretion disk and the thin disk is supposed to
turn to another ADAF on the inner side. The energy transfer is expected to
occur through turbulent mixing between the two layers and the upper layer is
discussed to have the positive specific energy large enough for the terminal
velocity to be $\sim$ 0.1 $c$. For the steady jets from SS433, a slim disk is
argued to separate into two stratified layers due to the photon diffusion in
the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane under the advection
dominated situation. In this case, the specific energy of the upper layer is
expected to be positive such that the terminal velocity exceeds 0.2 $c$. The
jet ejection process near the black hole is investigated commonly to both the
two-layer cases and predicts the jet opening angle becomes as small as
2$^{\circ}$.
