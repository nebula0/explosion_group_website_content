 High-redshift observations are often biased towards massive and bright
galaxies that are not necessarily representative of the full population. In
order to accurately study galaxy evolution and mass assembly at these
redshifts, observations of ``normal'' main sequence galaxies are required. Here
we present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 0.3" resolution
observations of the [CII] emission line at 158$\mu$m of HZ7, a main sequence
galaxy at $z=5.25$. Comparing to archival rest-frame UV observations taken by
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find strong evidence of the existence of
extended [CII] emission, which we estimate to be twice the size of the
rest-frame UV emission, yielding one of the first high-redshift objects where a
clear signature of a [CII] ``Halo'' has been detected to date. For a matched
S\'ersic profile with n = 1, we measured a [CII] effective radius of $0.50\pm
0.04$" (3.07$\pm 0.25$ kpc) and an average rest-frame UV effective radius of
$0.2\pm0.04$" ($1.48\pm0.16$ kpc). The [CII] morphology and kinematics of the
system suggest a merging event resulting in a non rotating disk system. This
event could be responsible for the extended [CII] emission. Alternatively, some
potential obscured emission could also explain the [CII] to UV size ratio.
These results contribute to the growing consensus with respect to the existence
of extended [CII] emission around galaxies.
