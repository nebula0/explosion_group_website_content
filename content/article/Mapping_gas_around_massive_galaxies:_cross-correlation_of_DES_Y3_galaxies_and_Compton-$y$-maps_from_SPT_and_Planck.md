 We cross-correlate positions of galaxies measured in data from the first
three years of the Dark Energy Survey with Compton-$y$-maps generated using
data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the {\it Planck} mission. We model
this cross-correlation measurement together with the galaxy auto-correlation to
constrain the distribution of gas in the Universe. We measure the hydrostatic
mass bias or, equivalently, the mean halo bias-weighted electron pressure
$\langle b_{h}P_{e}\rangle$, using large-scale information. We find $\langle
b_{h}P_{e}\rangle$ to be
$[0.16^{+0.03}_{-0.04},0.28^{+0.04}_{-0.05},0.45^{+0.06}_{-0.10},0.54^{+0.08}_{-0.07},0.61^{+0.08}_{-0.06},0.63^{+0.07}_{-0.08}]$
meV cm$^{-3}$ at redshifts $z \sim [0.30, 0.46, 0.62,0.77, 0.89, 0.97]$. These
values are consistent with previous work where measurements exist in the
redshift range. We also constrain the mean gas profile using small-scale
information, enabled by the high-resolution of the SPT data. We compare our
measurements to different parametrized profiles based on the cosmo-OWLS
hydrodynamical simulations. We find that our data are consistent with the
simulation that assumes an AGN heating temperature of $10^{8.5}$K but are
incompatible with the model that assumes an AGN heating temperature of
$10^{8.0}$K. These comparisons indicate that the data prefer a higher value of
electron pressure than the simulations within $r_{500c}$ of the galaxies'
halos.
