 The diversity of dynamical conditions among exoplanets is now well
established. Yet, the relevance of orbital dynamical timescales to biological
evolutionary timescales is poorly understood. Given that even minor orbital
changes may place significant pressure on any organisms living on a planet,
dynamical sculpting has important implications for the putative evolution of
life. In this manuscript, we employ a Monte Carlo framework to investigate how
a range of exoplanetary dynamical sculpting timescales affects timescales for
biological evolution. We proceed with minimal assumptions for how dynamical
sculpting proceeds and the emergence and persistence of life. We focus our
investigation on M dwarf stars, the most common exoplanetary hosts in the Milky
Way. We assign dynamical statuses, dependent on stellar age, to a suite of
planetary systems, varying the rate of dynamical disruption within limits that
are consistent with present-day planet demographics. We then simulate the
observed yield of planets according to the completeness of NASA's Kepler and
TESS missions, and investigate the properties of these samples. With this
simplified approach, we find that systems hosting multiple transiting planets
ought to have, on average, shorter dynamically-uninterrupted intervals than
single-transiting systems. However, depending upon the rate of dynamical
sculpting, planets orbiting older stars will exhibit the opposite trend. Even
modest constraints on stellar age would help identify "older" stars for which
this holds. The degree of these effects varies, dependent upon both the
intrinsic dynamical demographics of exoplanets and whether we consider planets
detected by NASA's Kepler or TESS missions.
