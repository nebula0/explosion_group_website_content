        We present new, deep optical observations of the early-type galaxy NGC 4278, which is located in a small loose group. We find that the galaxy lacks fine substructure, i.e., appears relaxed, out to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc. Our g- and i-band surface brightness profiles are uniform down to our deepest levels of $\sim$28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Combined with archival globular cluster (GC) number density maps and a new analysis of the total mass distribution, we find that the red GC subpopulation traces well the stellar mass density profile between 2.4 and 14 half-mass radii while the blue GC subpopulation traces the total mass density profile of the galaxy. Furthermore, the red GC spatial distribution has an ellipticity consistent with the stellar mass (eps $\approx$ 0.1) and is well centered on it. On the other hand, the blue GC distribution is more elongated (0.25 &lt; eps &lt; 0.4) and offset in the northwest direction by 2-3 kpc. Our results reinforce the scenario that red GCs form mostly in-situ along with the stellar component of the galaxy, while the blue GCs are more closely aligned with the total mass distribution in the halo and were accreted along with halo matter.
