 Dark matter could comprise, at least in part, primordial black holes (PBH).
To test this hypothesis, we present an approach to constrain the PBH mass
($M_{\rm{PBH}}$) and mass fraction ($f_{\rm{PBH}}$) from the flux ratios of
quadruply imaged quasars. Our approach uses an approximate Bayesian computation
(ABC) forward modeling technique to directly sample the posterior distribution
of $M_{\rm{PBH}}$ and $f_{\rm{PBH}}$, while marginalizing over the subhalo mass
function amplitude, spatial distribution, and the size of the lensed source. We
apply our method to 11 quadruply-imaged quasars and derive a new constraint on
the intermediate-mass area of PBH parameter space $10^4
$M$_{\odot}<M_{\rm{PBH}}<10^6$M$_\odot$. We obtain an upper limit
$f_{\mathrm{PBH}}<0.17$ (95\% C.L.). This constraint is independent of all
other previously published limits.
