 We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) integral field spectroscopy (IFS)
observations of rest-frame UV emission lines $\rm Ly\alpha$, C IV $\lambda
\lambda$ 1548 \AA, 1550\AA and He II 1640 \AA observed in the circumgalactic
medium (CGM) of two $z=2$ radio-loud quasar host galaxies. We detect extended
emission on 80-90 kpc scale in $\rm Ly\alpha$ in both systems with C IV, and He
II emission also detected out to 30-50 kpc. All emission lines show kinematics
with a blue and redshifted gradient pattern consistent with velocities seen in
massive dark matter halos and similar to kinematic patterns of inflowing gas
seen in hydrodynamical simulations. Using the kinematics of both resolved $\rm
Ly\alpha$ emission and absorption, we can confirm that both kinematic
structures are associated with accretion. Combining the KCWI data with
molecular gas observations with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) and high spatial resolution of ionized gas with Keck OSIRIS, we find
that both quasar host galaxies reside in proto-group environments at $z=2$. We
estimate $1-6\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$ of warm-ionized gas within 30-50 kpc from
the quasar that is likely accreting onto the galaxy group. We estimate inflow
rates of 60-200 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, within an order of magnitude of the outflow
rates in these systems. In the 4C 09.17 system, we detect narrow gas streams
associated with satellite galaxies, potentially reminiscent of ram-pressure
stripping seen in local galaxy groups and clusters. We find that the quasar
host galaxies reside in dynamically complex environments, with ongoing mergers,
gas accretion, ISM stripping, and outflows likely playing an important role in
shaping the assembly and evolution of massive galaxies at cosmic noon.
