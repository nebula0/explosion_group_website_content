 Fast radio bursts are millisecond-duration pulses of radio emission that have
been found to originate at extragalactic distances. The bursts show dispersion
imparted by intervening plasma, with the bulk attributed to the intergalactic
medium. Here we report the discovery of a burst, FRB20220610A, in a complex
host galaxy system at a redshift of $z=1.016 \pm 0.002$. The relationship
between its redshift and dispersion confirm that the bulk of the baryonic
matter was ionized and in the intergalactic medium when the universe was almost
half its present age. The burst shows evidence for passage through a
significant additional column of turbulent and magnetized high-redshift plasma.
It extends the maximum observed burst energy by a factor of four, confirming
the presence of an energetic burst population at high redshift.
