 In the previous paper [arXiv:2210.10435], the nonlinear perturbation theory
of cosmological density field is generalized to include the tensor-valued bias
of astronomical objects, such as spins and shapes of galaxies and any other
tensors of arbitrary ranks which are associated with objects that we can
observe. We apply this newly developed method to explicitly calculate nonlinear
power spectra and correlation functions both in real space and in redshift
space. Multi-dimensional integrals that appeared in loop corrections are
reduced to combinations of the one-dimensional Hankel transforms, thanks to the
spherical basis of the formalism, and the final expressions are numerically
evaluated in a very short time using an algorithm of the fast Fourier
transforms such as FFTLog. As an illustrative example, numerical evaluations of
loop corrections of the power spectrum and correlation function of the rank-2
tensor field are demonstrated with a simple model of tensor bias.
