 We present a comparative study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) between galaxy
pairs and isolated galaxies with the final data release of the MaNGA integral
field spectroscopic survey. We build a sample of 391 kinematic galaxy pairs
within the footprint of the survey and select AGN using the survey's spectra.
We use the comoving volume densities of the AGN samples to quantify the effects
that tidal interactions have on the triggering of nuclear accretion. Our
hypothesis is that the pair sample contains AGN that are triggered by not only
stochastic accretion but also tidally induced accretion and correlated
accretion. With the level of stochastically triggered AGN fixed by the control
sample, we model the strength of tidally induced accretion and correlated
accretion as a function of projected separation (rp) and compare the model
expectations with the observed volume densities of dual AGN and offset AGN
(single AGN in a pair). At rp ~ 10 kpc, we find that tidal interactions induce
~30% more AGN than stochastic fueling and cause ~12% of the offset AGN to
become dual AGN because of correlations. The strength of both these effects
decreases with increasing rp. We also find that the OIII luminosities of the
AGN in galaxy pairs are consistent with those found in isolated galaxies,
likely because stochastically fed AGN dominate even among close pairs. Our
results illustrates that while we can detect tidally induced effects
statistically, it is challenging to separate tidally induced AGN and
stochastically triggered AGN in interacting galaxies.
