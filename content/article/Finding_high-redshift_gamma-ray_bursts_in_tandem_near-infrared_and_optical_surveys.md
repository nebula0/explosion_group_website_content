 The race for the most distant object in the Universe has been played by
long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), star-forming galaxies and quasars. GRBs
took a temporary lead with the discovery of GRB 090423 at a redshift z=8.2, but
now the record-holder is the galaxy GN-z11 at z=11.0. Despite this record,
galaxies and quasars are very faint (GN-z11 has a magnitude H=26), hampering
the study of the physical properties of the primordial Universe. On the other
hand, GRB afterglows are brighter by a factor of >100, with the drawback of
lasting only for 1-2 days. Here we describe a novel approach to the discovery
of high-redshift (z>6) GRBs, exploiting their near-infrared (nIR) emission
properties. Soon after the bright, high-energy prompt phase, a GRB is
accompanied by an afterglow. The afterglows of high-redshift GRBs are naturally
absorbed, like any other source, at optical wavelengths by Hydrogen along the
line of sight in the intergalactic medium (Lyman-alpha absorption). We propose
to take advantage of the deep monitoring of the sky by the Vera Rubin
Observatory, to simultaneously observe exactly the same fields with a new,
dedicated nIR facility. By comparing the two streams of transients, one can
pinpoint transients detected in the nIR band and not in the optical band. These
fast transients detected only in the nIR and with an AB colour index r-H>3.5
are high-redshift GRBs, with a low contamination rate. Thanks to the depth
reached by the Rubin observations, interlopers can be identified, allowing us
to discover ~11 GRBs at z>6 per year and ~3 GRBs per year at z>10. This turns
out to be one of the most effective probes of the high-redshift Universe.
