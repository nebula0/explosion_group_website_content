 This work focuses on the gas chemical composition of CGCG007-025. This
compact dwarf is undergoing a galaxy wide star forming burst, whose spatial
behaviour has been observed by VLT/MUSE. We present a new line measurement
library to treat almost 7800 voxels. The direct method chemical analysis is
limited to 484 voxels with good detection of the $[SIII]6312\AA$ temperature
diagnostic line. The recombination fluxes are corrected for stellar absorption
via a population synthesis. Additionally, we discuss a new algorithm to fit
photoionization models via neural networks. The 8 ionic abundances analyzed
show a spatial normal distribution with a $\sigma\sim0.1\,dex$, where only half
this value can be explained by the uncertainty in the measurements. The oxygen
abundance distribution is $12+log(O/H)=7.88\pm0.11$. The $T_{e}[SIII]$ and
$ne[SII]$ are also normally distributed. However, in the central and brightest
region, the $ne[SII]$ is almost thrice the mean galaxy value. This is also
reflected in the extinction measurements. The ionization parameter has a
distribution of $log(U) = -2.52^{0.17}_{0.19}$. The parameter spatial behaviour
agrees with the $S^{2+}/S^{+}$ map. Finally, the discrepancies between the
direct method and the photoionization model fitting are discussed. In the
latter technique, we find that mixing lines with uneven uncertainty magnitudes
can impact the accuracy of the results. In these fittings, we recommend
overestimating the minimum flux uncertainty one order below the maximum line
flux uncertainty. This provides a better match with the direct method.
