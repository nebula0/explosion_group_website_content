 The study of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) is vital in order to understand
their respective nuclei bounded activity primarily triggered by the accretion
disk and the associated corona. The hard X-ray emission characterised by the
spectral index $\Gamma$ emitted by these sources in 2-10 keV band ionizes the
nearby physical features like disk, BLR, NLR and provides a radiative
configuration. However, based on previous studies, there is degeneracy in the
evolution of $\Gamma$ across the redshift, wherein few studies display a
systematic trend in the evolution and others rule out the systematic variation.
In the present work, we study the evolution of $\Gamma$ across the redshift for
a very large sample and perform further studies on the variation of $\Gamma$
with optical parameters using SDSS data viz. H$_{\beta}$ \& Mg II and their
luminosities. Based on analysis we find that there is no change in $\Gamma$
across the redshift and it does not show any correlation with the optical
parameters. This strongly suggests that the $\Gamma$ is influenced by the soft
excess and/or reflection component and is affecting the disk and BLR region at
the same strength across the redshift.
