 Motivated by observational results, we use hydrodynamical numerical
simulations to study the alignment of the central galaxies in groups with the
surrounding structures. This approach allows us to analyse galaxy and group
properties not available in observations. To perform this analysis, we use a
modified version of the two-point cross-correlation function and a measure of
the angle between the semi-major axes of the central galaxies and the larger
structures. Overall, our results reproduce observational ones, as we find
large-scale anisotropy, which is dominated by the red central galaxies. In
addition, the latter is noticeably more aligned with their group than the blue
ones. In contrast to the observations, we find a strong dependence of the
anisotropy on the central galaxy with mass, probably associated with the
inability of observational methods to determine them. This result allows us to
link the alignment to the process of halo assembly and the well-known
dependence of halo anisotropy on mass. When we include dark matter particles in
the analysis, it allows us to conclude that the alignment detected in both
observations and simulations is the consequence of a sequence of alignments
ranging from the central galaxy to the large-scale structure, probably as a
consequence of a combination of different physical processes.
