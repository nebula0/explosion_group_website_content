 We use data from the 17th data release of the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE 2) to contrast the chemical composition
of the recently discovered Gaia Enceladus/Sausage system (GE/S) to those of ten
Milky Way (MW) dwarf satellite galaxies: LMC, SMC, Bo\"otes I, Carina, Draco,
Fornax, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Our main focus is on the
distributions of the stellar populations of those systems in the $[Mg/Fe]$-$[Fe/H]$
and $[Mg/Mn]$-$[Al/Fe]$ planes, which are commonly employed in the literature for
chemical diagnosis and where dwarf galaxies can be distinguished from in situ
populations. We show that, unlike MW satellites, a GE/S sample defined purely
on the basis of orbital parameters falls almost entirely within the locus of
"accreted" stellar populations in chemical space, which is likely caused by an
early quenching of star formation in GE/S. Due to a more protracted history of
star formation, stars in the metal-rich end of the MW satellite populations are
characterized by lower $[Mg/Mn]$ than those of their GE/S counterparts. The
chemical compositions of GE/S stars are consistent with a higher early star
formation rate than MW satellites of comparable and even higher mass,
suggesting that star formation in the early universe was strongly influenced by
other parameters in addition to mass. We find that the direction of the
metallicity gradient in the $[Mg/Mn]$-$[Al/Fe]$ plane of dwarf galaxies is an
indicator of the early star formation rate of the system
