 We present the first clustering measurement of Strong Blended Lyman $\alpha$
(SBLA) absorption systems by measuring their cross-correlation with the Lyman
$\alpha$ forest. SBLAs are a new population of absorbers detected within the
Lyman $\alpha$ forest. We find a bias of $2.329\pm0.057$, consistent with that
of Damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs). For DLAs, we recover a bias of
$2.331\pm0.057$ larger than previously reported (P\'erez-R\`afols et al.
2018b). We also find a redshift space distortion parameter
$\beta=0.417\pm0.010$, also consistent with the recovered value for DLAs
($\beta=0.416\pm0.010$). This is consistent with SBLA and DLA systems tracing
different portions of the circumgalactic medium of a broadly common population
of galaxies. Given these common clustering properties, we combined them to
perform a cross-correlation of galaxies in absorption with the Ly$\alpha$
forest. We find that the BAO scale uncertainty of this new measurement is
$1.75\times$ that of Ly$\alpha$ auto-correlation and $1.6\times$ that of the
quasar cross-correlation with the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We note that the current
preferred metal contamination model for fitting the correlation functions with
respect to the Ly$\alpha$ forest is not realistic enough for SBLA systems,
likely due to their status as high redshift precision sites of high metal
enrichment. Mock spectra including SBLA systems and their associated metal
absorption are required to understand this sample fully. We conclude that SBLAs
have the potential to complement the standard Ly$\alpha$ cosmological analyses
in future surveys.
