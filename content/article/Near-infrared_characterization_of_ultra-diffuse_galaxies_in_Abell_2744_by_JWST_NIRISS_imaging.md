 We present a search and characterization of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in
the Frontier Fields cluster Abell 2744 at $z=0.308$. We use JWST/NIRISS F200W
observations, acquired as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program,
aiming to characterize morphologies of cluster UDGs and their diffuse stellar
components. A total number of 22 UDGs are identified by our selection criteria
using morphological parameters, down to stellar mass of $\sim10^{7}M_{\odot}$.
The selected UDGs are systematically larger in effective radius in F200W than
in HST/ACS F814W images, which implies that some of them would not have been
identified as UDGs when selected at rest-frame optical wavelengths. In fact, we
find that about one third of the UDGs were not previously identified based on
the F814W data. We observe a flat distribution of the UDGs in the stellar
mass-size plane, similar to what is found for cluster quiescent galaxies at
comparable mass. We also find 10 potential candidates with disturbed
morphologies, a previously overlooked but important population as a possible
progenitor of the local UDGs. Our pilot study using the new JWST F200W filter
showcases the efficiency of searching UDGs at cosmological distances, with 1/30
of the exposure time of the previous deep observing campaign with HST. Further
studies with JWST focusing on spatially-resolved properties of individual
sources will provide insight into their origin.
