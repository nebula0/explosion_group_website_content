 This paper systematically studies the relation between metallicity and mass
loss of massive stars. We perform one-dimensional stellar evolution simulations
and build a grid of $\sim$2000 models with initial masses ranging between 11
and 60 $M_{\odot}$ and absolute metallicities $Z$ between 0.00001 and 0.02.
Steady-state winds, comprising hot main-sequence winds and cool supergiant
winds, are the main drivers of the mass loss of massive stars in our models. We
calculate the total mass loss over the stellar lifetime for each model. Our
results reveal the existence of a critical metallicity $Z_{\rm{c}}$ at $Z \sim
10^{-3}$, where the mass loss exhibits a dramatic jump. If $Z>Z_{\rm{c}}$,
massive stars tend to evolve into cool supergiants, and a robust cool wind is
operational. In contrast, if $Z<Z_{\rm{c}}$, massive stars usually remain as
blue supergiants, wherein the cool wind is not activated and the mass loss is
generally weak. Moreover, we calculate the wind feedback in a $10^5$
$M_{\odot}$ star cluster with the Salpeter initial mass function. The kinetic
energy released by winds does not exhibit any significant transition at
$Z_{\rm{c}}$ because the wind velocity of a cool supergiant wind is low and
contributes little to the kinetic energy. The effects of critical metallicity
provide implications for the fates of metal-poor stars in the early universe.
