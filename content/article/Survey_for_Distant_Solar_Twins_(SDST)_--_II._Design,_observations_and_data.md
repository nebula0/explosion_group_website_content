 Studies of solar twins have key impacts on the astronomical community, but
only $\sim$100--200 nearby solar twins ($<$ 1 kpc) have been reliably
identified over the last few decades. The aim of our survey (SDST) is to
identify $\sim$150--200 distant solar twins and analogues (up to $\lesssim$ 4
kpc) closer to the Galactic Centre. We took advantage of the precise Gaia and
Skymapper surveys to select Sun-like candidates in a 2-degree field, which were
observed with the HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We
successfully built up the required signal-to-noise ratio (25-per-pixel in the
HERMES red band) for most targets as faint as Gaia G of 17.4 mag. The stellar
photometric/astrometric parameters (e.g., \teff, \logg, mass) of our candidates
are derived in this paper, while the spectroscopic parameters will be presented
in the third paper in this SDST series. The selection success rate - the
fraction of targets which belong to solar twins or analogues - was estimated
from simulated survey data and the Besan\c{c}on stellar population model, and
compared with the actual success rate of the survey. We find that expected and
actual success rates agree well, indicating that the numbers of solar twins and
analogues we discover in SDST are consistent with expectations, affirming the
survey approach. These distant solar analogues are prime targets for testing
for any variation in the strength of electromagnetism in regions of higher dark
matter density, and can make additional contributions to our understanding of,
e.g., Galactic chemical evolution in the inner Milky Way.
