 Modeling the 21cm global signal from the Cosmic Dawn is challenging due to
the many poorly constrained physical processes that come into play. We address
this problem using the semi-analytical code "Cosmic Archaeology Tool" (CAT).
CAT follows the evolution of dark matter halos tracking their merger history
and provides an ab initio description of their baryonic evolution, starting
from the formation of the first (Pop III) stars and black holes (BHs) in
mini-halos at z > 20. The model is anchored to observations of galaxies and AGN
at z < 6 and predicts a reionization history consistent with constraints. In
this work we compute the evolution of the mean global 21cm signal between
$4\leq z \leq 40$ based on the rate of formation and emission properties of
stars and accreting black holes. We obtain an absorption profile with a maximum
depth $\delta {\rm T_b} = -95$ mK at $z \sim 26.5$ (54 MHz). This feature is
quickly suppressed turning into an emission signal at $z = 20$ due to the
contribution of accreting BHs that efficiently heat the IGM at $z < 27$. The
high-$z$ absorption feature is caused by the early coupling between the spin
and kinetic temperature of the IGM induced by Pop III star formation episodes
in mini-halos. Once we account for an additional radio background from early
BHs, we are able to reproduce the timing and the depth of the EDGES signal only
if we consider a smaller X-ray background from accreting BHs, but not the
shape.
