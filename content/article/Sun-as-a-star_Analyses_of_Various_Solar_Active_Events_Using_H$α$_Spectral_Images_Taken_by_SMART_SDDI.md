 Sun-as-a-star analyses, in which observational data is spatially integrated,
are useful for interpreting stellar data. For future applications to stellar
observations, we performed Sun-as-a-star analyses of H$\alpha$ spectra for
various active events on the Sun, not only for flares and filament
eruptions/surges on the solar disk, but also for eruptions of off limb
prominences using H$\alpha$ spectral images taken by the Solar Magnetic
Activity Research Telescope / Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager (SMART/SDDI) at
Hida Observatory, Kyoto University. All the analyzed events show emission
relative to the pre-event state and the changes in their H$\alpha$ equivalent
widths are all on the orders of 10$^{-4}$ \r{A}. Sun-as-a-star H$\alpha$
spectra exhibit different features depending on the causes of the emission: (i)
Flares show emission at the H$\alpha$ line center, together with red asymmetry
and line broadening, as reported in a previous study. (ii) Filament eruptions
with and without flares show emission near the H$\alpha$ line center,
accompanied by blue-/red-shifted absorption. Notably, disappearance of dark
filaments leads to the apparent enhancement of the H$\alpha$ line center
emission. (iii) Eruptions of off limb prominences show blue-/red-shifted
emission. These spectral features enable us to identify the active phenomena on
Sun-like stars. We have also found that even the filament eruptions showing
red-shifted absorptions in Sun-as-a-star H$\alpha$ spectra lead to coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). This result suggests that even if the falling components of
stellar filament eruptions are detected as red-shifted absorptions in H$\alpha$
spectra, such stellar filament eruptions may also develop into CMEs.
