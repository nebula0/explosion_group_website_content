 CIZA J1358.9-4750 is a nearby galaxy cluster in the early phase of a major
merger. The two-dimensional temperature map using XMM-Newton EPIC-PN
observation confirms the existence of a high temperature region, which we call
the "hot region", in the "bridge region" connecting the two clusters. The ~ 500
kpc wide region between the southeast and northwest boundaries also has higher
pseudo pressure compared to the unshocked regions, suggesting the existence of
two shocks. The southern shock front is clearly visible in the X-ray surface
brightness image and has already been reported by Kato et al. (2015). The
northern one, on the other hand, is newly discovered. To evaluate their Mach
number, we constructed a three-dimensional toy merger model with overlapping
shocked and unshocked components in line of sight. The unshocked and preshock
ICM conditions are estimated based on those outside the interacting bridge
region assuming point symmetry. The hot region spectra are modeled with
two-temperature thermal components, assuming that the shocked condition follows
the Rankin-Hugoniot relation with the preshock condition. As a result, the
shocked region is estimated to have a line-of-sight depth of ~ 1 Mpc with a
Mach number of ~ 1.3 in the southeast shock and ~ 1.7 in the northwest shock.
The age of the shock waves is estimated to be ~ 260 Myr. This three dimensional
merger model is consistent with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal obtained using the
Planck observation within the CMB fluctuations. The total flow of the kinetic
energy of the ICM through the southeast shock was estimated to be ~ 2.2 x
$10^{42}$ erg/s. Assuming that 10 % of this energy is converted into ICM
turbulence, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion is calculated to be ~ 200
km/s, which is basically resolvable via coming high spectral resolution
observations.
