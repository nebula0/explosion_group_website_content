 We present the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY)
Pilot Phase I HI kinematic models. This first data release consists of HI
observations of three fields in the direction of the Hydra and Norma clusters,
and the NGC 4636 galaxy group. In this paper, we describe how we generate and
publicly release flat-disk tilted-ring kinematic models for 109/592 unique HI
detections in these fields. The modelling method adopted here - which we call
the WALLABY Kinematic Analysis Proto-Pipeline (WKAPP) and for which the
corresponding scripts are also publicly available - consists of combining
results from the homogeneous application of the FAT and 3DBAROLO algorithms to
the subset of 209 detections with sufficient resolution and S/N in order to
generate optimized model parameters and uncertainties. The 109 models presented
here tend to be gas rich detections resolved by at least 3-4 synthesized beams
across their major axes, but there is no obvious environmental bias in the
modelling. The data release described here is the first step towards the
derivation of similar products for thousands of spatially-resolved WALLABY
detections via a dedicated kinematic pipeline. Such a large publicly available
and homogeneously analyzed dataset will be a powerful legacy product that that
will enable a wide range of scientific studies.
