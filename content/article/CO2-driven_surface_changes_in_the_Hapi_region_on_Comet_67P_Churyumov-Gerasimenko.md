 Between 2014 December 31 and 2015 March 17, the OSIRIS cameras on Rosetta
documented the growth of a 140m wide and 0.5m deep depression in the Hapi
region on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This shallow pit is one of several
that later formed elsewhere on the comet, all in smooth terrain that primarily
is the result of airfall of coma particles. We have compiled observations of
this region in Hapi by the microwave instrument MIRO on Rosetta, acquired
during October and November 2014. We use thermophysical and radiative transfer
models in order to reproduce the MIRO observations. This allows us to place
constraints on the thermal inertia, diffusivity, chemical composition,
stratification, extinction coefficients, and scattering properties of the
surface material, and how they evolved during the months prior to pit
formation. The results are placed in context through long-term comet nucleus
evolution modelling. We propose that: 1) MIRO observes signatures that are
consistent with a solid-state greenhouse effect in airfall material; 2) CO2 ice
is sufficiently close to the surface to have a measurable effect on MIRO
antenna temperatures, and likely is responsible for the pit formation in Hapi
observed by OSIRIS; 3) the pressure at the CO2 sublimation front is
sufficiently strong to expel dust and water ice outwards, and to compress comet
material inwards, thereby causing the near-surface compaction observed by
CONSERT, SESAME, and groundbased radar, manifested as the "consolidated
terrain" texture observed by OSIRIS.
