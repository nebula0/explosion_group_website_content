 We examine the temperature structure of static coronal active region loops in
regimes where thermal conductive transport is driven by Coulomb collisions, by
turbulent scattering, or by a combination of the two. (In the last case
collisional scattering dominates the heat transport at lower levels in the loop
where temperatures are low and densities are high, while turbulent scattering
dominates the heat transport at higher temperatures/lower densities.)
Temperature profiles and their corresponding differential emission measure
distributions are calculated and compared to observations, and earlier scaling
laws relating the loop apex temperature and volumetric heating rate to the loop
length and pressure are revisited. Results reveal very substantial changes,
compared to the wholly collision-dominated case, to both the loop scaling laws
and the temperature/density profiles along the loop. They also show that the
well-known excess of differential emission measure at relatively low
temperatures in the loop may be a consequence of for by the flatter temperature
gradients (and so increased amount of material within a specified temperature
range) that results from the predominance of turbulent scattering in the upper
regions of the loop.
