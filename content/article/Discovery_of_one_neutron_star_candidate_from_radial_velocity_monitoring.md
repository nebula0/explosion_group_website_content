 We report the discovery of one possible neutron star binary ($P_{\rm orb} =$
0.8666 day) by using the LAMOST low-resolution spectroscopic data. The visible
companion is a late A-type dwarf ($T_{\rm eff} = 7900 \pm 200$ K; log$g$ $=$
4.3$\pm$0.2; $M =$ 1.7$\pm$0.1 M$_{\odot}$; $R\ =\ 1.7\pm0.2$ R$_{\odot}$), at
a distance of 1.11$\pm0.03$ kpc. No double-lined feature can be seen from the
GTC/HORuS high-resolution spectra, thus the radial velocity variation indicates
an invisible object hiding in the binary. The system's optical light curves
show clear ellipsoidal variability, suggesting that the visible companion is
tidal distorted. By fitting the multi-band light curves with the ELC and WD
codes, we constrain the mass of the invisible star to be 1.1--1.3 M$_{\odot}$.
Spectral disentangling shows no additional component with optical absorption
spectra, supporting the system contains one compact object. No X-ray or UV
emission are detected in the ROSAT archive observations. Therefore, we suspect
the invisible object is more likely a neutron star rather than a white dwarf.
Our finding suggests the ability of LAMOST spectroscopic survey to discover
X-ray quiescent compact objects.
