 Transiting exoplanets orbiting young nearby stars are ideal laboratories for
testing theories of planet formation and evolution. However, to date only a
handful of stars with age <1 Gyr have been found to host transiting exoplanets.
Here we present the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune around HD 18599,
a young (300 Myr), nearby (d=40 pc) K star. We validate the transiting planet
candidate as a bona fide planet using data from the TESS, Spitzer, and Gaia
missions, ground-based photometry from IRSF, LCO, PEST, and NGTS, speckle
imaging from Gemini, and spectroscopy from CHIRON, NRES, FEROS, and
Minerva-Australis. The planet has an orbital period of 4.13 d, and a radius of
2.7Rearth. The RV data yields a 3-sigma mass upper limit of 30.5Mearth which is
explained by either a massive companion or the large observed jitter typical
for a young star. The brightness of the host star (V~9 mag) makes it conducive
to detailed characterization via Doppler mass measurement which will provide a
rare view into the interior structure of young planets.
