 We present a family of analytical potential-density pairs for barred discs,
which can be combined to describe galactic bars in a realistic way, including
boxy/peanut components. We illustrate this with two reasonable compound models.
Computer code for the evaluation of potential, forces, density, and projected
density is freely provided.
