 We present proper motion measurements of oxygen-rich ejecta of the LMC
supernova remnant N132D using two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope Advanced
Camera for Surveys data spanning 16 years. The proper motions of 120 individual
knots of oxygen-rich gas were measured and used to calculate a center of
expansion (CoE) of $\alpha$=05:25:01.71 and $\delta$=-69:38:41.64 (J2000) with
a 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty of 2.90 arcseconds. This new CoE measurement is 9.2
and 10.8 arcseconds from two previous CoE estimates based on the geometry of
the optically emitting ejecta. We also derive an explosion age of 2770 $\pm$
500 yr, which is consistent with recent age estimates of $\approx 2500$ yr made
from 3D ejecta reconstructions. We verify our estimates of the CoE and age
using a new automated procedure that detected and tracked the proper motions of
137 knots, with 73 knots that overlap with the visually identified knots. We
find the proper motions of ejecta are still ballistic, despite the remnant's
age, and are consistent with the notion that the ejecta are expanding into an
ISM cavity. Evidence for explosion asymmetry from the parent supernova is also
observed. Using the visually measured proper motion measurements and
corresponding center of expansion and age, we compare N132D to other supernova
remnants with proper motion ejecta studies.
