 We present broadband radio flux-density measurements supernova (SN) 1996cr,
made with MeerKAT, ATCA and ALMA, and images made from very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations with the Australian Long Baseline Array. The
spectral energy distribution of SN 1996cr in 2020, at age, $t \sim$8700 d, is a
power-law, with flux density, $S\propto \nu^{-0.588 \pm 0.011}$ between 1 and
34 GHz, but may steepen at $>35$ GHz. The spectrum has flattened since $t =
5370$ d (2010). Also since $t = 5370$ d, the flux density has declined rapidly,
with $S_{\rm 9 GHz} \propto t^{-2.9}$. The VLBI image at $t = 8859$ d shows an
approximately circular structure, with a central minimum reminiscent of an
optically-thin spherical shell of emission. For a distance of 3.7 Mpc, the
average outer radius of the radio emission at that time was $(5.1 \pm 0.3)
\times 10^{17}$ cm, and SN 1996cr has been expanding with a velocity of $4650
\pm 1060$ km s$^{-1}$ between $t=4307$ and 8859 d. It must have undergone
considerable deceleration before $t = 4307$ d. Deviations from a circular shell
structure in the image suggest a range of velocities up to $\sim$7000 km
s$^{-1}$, and hint at the presence of a ring- or equatorial-belt-like structure
rather than a complete spherical shell.
