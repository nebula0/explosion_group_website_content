 We derive the Ultra-Violet (UV) luminosity function (LF) of star forming
galaxies falling in the redshift range $z = 0.6 - 1.2$, in the rest-frame
far-UV (1500 {\AA}) wavelength. For this work we are in particular interested
in the bright end of the UV LF in this redshift range. The data from
\textit{XMM-Newton} Optical Monitor (XMM-OM), near-ultraviolet (1600-4000
{\AA}) observations over 1.5 deg\textsuperscript{2} of the COSMOS field are
employed for this purpose. We compile a source-list of 879 sources with
$UVW1_\mathrm{AB}$ extending to $\sim 21$ mag from the wide area UVW1 image of
the COSMOS field. in the two bins $0.6 \leq z \leq 0.8$ and $0.8 \leq z \leq
1.2$. We use the maximum likelihood to fit the Schechter function to the
un-binned data to estimate the parameters (faint-end slope, characteristic
magnitude and normalisation) of the Schechter function. We find that the shape
of the LF is consistent with the Schechter model and the parameters are in fair
agreement with other studies conducted using direct measurements of the 1500
{\AA} flux. We see a brightening of the characteristic magnitude as we move
from lower (0.7) to higher (1.0) redshift. The measures for luminosity density
are within the error margins of past studies. We examine the brightest sources
in our sample for AGN contribution. These sources are characterised through
their spectral energy distributions (SEDs), integrated infrared luminosities
and morphologies. We also explore their overlap with the brightest IR galaxies
at similar redshift range.
