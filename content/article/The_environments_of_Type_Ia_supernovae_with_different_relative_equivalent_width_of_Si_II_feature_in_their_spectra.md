 Although type Ia supernovae are so important in many astrophysical field,
e.g. in cosmology, their explosion mechanism and progenitor system are still
unclear. In physics, the relative equivalent width (REW) of the Si II 635.5 nm
absorption feature reflects the velocity interval of silicon in the supernova
ejecta and then may provide constraints on the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia.
In this paper, we divide the SNe Ia into broad line (BL) and normal line (NL)
subsamples based on their REW of Si II 635.5 nm absorption lines around maximum
light, and find that the BL SNe Ia have a dimmer mean brightness than NL ones,
which possibly results from their different metallicities. However, based on
the pixel statistics study on the environments of two subsamples, we do not
find any significant potential difference on the environments between BL and NL
SNe Ia, which implies that the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia could be
independent of their progenitor populations.
