 Based on their differing radio morphologies, powerful radio galaxies can be
separated into the Fanaroff-Riley I (FR-I) and II (FR-II) classes. Hybrid
morphology radio sources (HyMoRS) contain morphologies consistent with each
type of jet on either side: a powerful, highly relativistic FR-II-like jet
terminating in a hotspot on one side and an FRI-like plume on the other. HyMoRS
present a unique opportunity to study the conditions which give rise to the
dichotomy. Using host galaxy properties, we conduct the first multiwavelength
investigation into whether orientation can explain HyMoRS morphology. Through
optical spectroscopy and mid-infrared photometry, we analyze the emission
characteristics, and evaluate the broad characteristics of five HyMoRS host
galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.4 < z < 1.5). The HyMoRS host galaxies in
our sample have properties consistent with typical host galaxies of FR-II
sources, suggesting that the observed hybrid morphologies may be caused by a
dense, cluster-like environment bending FR-II jets combined with a favorable
orientation which can make one side appear similar to an FR-I jet. Our results
thus support the hypothesis that HyMoRS are mainly caused by environment and
orientation.
