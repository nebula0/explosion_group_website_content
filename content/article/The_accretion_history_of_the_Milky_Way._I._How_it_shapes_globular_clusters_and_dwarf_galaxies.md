 Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star and globular
clusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that
include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as
self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of
globular clusters depends on their orbital pericenter and total energy, and
that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest
that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by
the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass
growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with
numerous orbits. This calibration starts from the bulge, to Kraken, Gaia
Sausage Enceladus, Sagittarius stellar systems, and finally to the new coming
dwarfs, either or not linked to the vast-polar structure. The most eccentric
globular clusters and dwarfs have their half-light radius scaling as the
inverse of their binding energy, and this over more than two decades. This
means that earlier arriving satellites are smaller due to the tidal effects of
the MW. Therefore, most halo inhabitants appear to have their structural
parameters shaped by MW tides and also by ram-pressure for the most recent
arrivals, the dwarf galaxies. The correlations found in this study can be used
as tools to further investigate the origin of globular clusters and dwarfs, as
well as the assembly history of our Galaxy.
