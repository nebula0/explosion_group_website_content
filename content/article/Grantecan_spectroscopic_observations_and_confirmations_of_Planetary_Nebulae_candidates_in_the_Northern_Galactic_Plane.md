 We present Grantecan 10 m telescope (GTC) spectroscopic confirmations of 55
faint Planetary Nebulae (PNe) candidates discovered largely in the INT
Photometric H$_\alpha$ Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS) by our
pro-am collaboration. We confirm 46 of them as 'True' (T), 4 as 'Likely' (L)
and 5 as 'Possible' (P) PNe and including 5 new PNe central star (CSPN)
discoveries. This was from observations of 62 new candidates yielding a maximum
PN discovery success rate of 89%. The sensitivity and longer wavelength
coverage of IPHAS allows PNe to be found in regions of greater extinction and
at these lower Galactic latitudes, including PNe in a more advanced
evolutionary state and at larger distances compared to previously known
Galactic PNe. We use an holistic set of observed characteristics and optical
emission-line diagnostics to confirm candidates. Plasma properties have been
determined in a self-consistent way using PyNeb. This work is facilitated by
the functionality of our powerful, multi-wavelength database 'HASH' (Hong Kong,
Australian Astronomical Observatory, Strasbourg Observatory H-alpha Planetary
Nebula catalogue) that federates known imaging, spectroscopy and other
pertinent data for all Galactic T, L, P PNe and the significant numbers of
mimics. Reddenings, corrected radial velocities and PNe electron density and
temperature estimates are provided for these new PNe where possible.
