 Context. The globular cluster (GC) system of Circinus galaxy has not been
probed previously partly because of the location of the galaxy at - 3.8$^\circ$
Galactic latitude which suffers severely from interstellar extinction, stellar
crowding, and Galactic foreground contamination. However, the deep
near-infrared (NIR) photometry by the VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea
Extended Survey (VVVX) in combination with the precise astrometry of Gaia EDR3
allow us to map GCs in this region.
  Aims. Our long-term goal is to study and characterise the distributions of
GCs and Ultra-compact dwarfs of Circinus galaxy which is the nearest Seyfert II
galaxy. Here we conduct the first pilot search for GCs in this galaxy.
  Methods. We use NIR VVVX photometry in combination with Gaia EDR3 astrometric
features such as astrometric excess noise and BP/RP excess factor to build the
first homogeneous catalogue of GCs in Circinus galaxy. A robust combination of
selection criteria allows us to effectively clean interlopers from our sample.
  Results. We report the detection of$\sim$ 70 GC candidates in this galaxy at
a 3 $\sigma$ confidence level. They show a bimodal colour distribution with the
blue peak at (G-Ks)$_0$ = 0.985$\pm$0.127 mag with a dispersion of
0.211$\pm$0.091 mag and the red peak at (G-Ks)$_0$ = 1.625$\pm$0.177 mag with a
dispersion of 0.482$\pm$0.114 mag. A GC specific frequency (S$_N$) of
1.3$\pm$0.2 was derived for the galaxy, and we estimated a total population of
120$\pm$40 GCs. Based on the projected radial distribution it appears that
Circinus has a different distribution of GC candidates than MW and M31.
  Conclusions. We demonstrate that Circinus galaxy hosts a sizeable number of
cluster candidates. This result is the first leap towards understanding the
evolution of old stellar clusters in this galaxy.
