 The confirmation of the presence of very massive quiescent galaxies at epochs
only 1-2 Gyr after the Big Bang $[1-8]$ has challenged models of cosmology and
galaxy formation $[9]$. Producing sufficient numbers of these requires abundant
numbers of the host dark matter halos to have been assembled and sufficient
time for star formation to proceed extremely quickly and then cease just as
rapidly. Ground-based spectroscopy has suggested ages of 200-300 Myr$[3]$ at
redshifts $3<z<4$. The true number and ages of these objects have however been
highly uncertain as ground-based spectra has been limited to the brightest of
them $[e.g. 3, 5]$, at wavelengths ~2$\mu$m, which introduces a signficant
potential bias towards younger objects $[7]$. The launch of the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) enables dramatically more sensitive and constraining
spectroscopic observations due to the very low sky background, sharp image
quality, and access to wavelengths beyond 2{\mu}m. Here we report JWST NIRSpec
$[10]$ (0.6-5.3$\mu$m) observations of five new quiescent galaxy candidates that
were beyond the limit of previous ground-based spectroscopy. The high
signal:noise spectra of galaxies with continuum significantly fainter than
earlier confirmations show that they are also at redshifts 3<z<4, and that they
have substantial stellar masses of ~0.5-1.2x1011 M$\odot$ comparable to massive
galaxies in the nearby Universe. One of the galaxies has been quenched for >~ 1
billion years pointing to a presence of substantially older and fainter
galaxies than those revealed so far by ground-based spectroscopy. This suggests
that some of the massive galaxies have very early formation epochs (during the
epoch of reionization, z >~ 6) pointing to a need for high conversion rates of
baryons to stars in the first massive galaxy halos in the early Universe $[11,
12]$.
