 Scandium is a key element of the Am star phenomenon since its surface
under-abundance is one of the criteria that characterise such stars. Thanks to
the availability of a sufficiently complete set of theoretical atomic data for
this element, reliable radiative accelerations for Sc can now be computed,
which allows its behaviour under the action of atomic diffusion to be modelled.
We explore the required conditions, in terms of mixing processes or mass loss,
for our models to reproduce the observed surface abundances of Sc in Am stars.
The models are computed with the Toulouse-Geneva evolution code, which uses the
parametric single-valued parameter method for the calculation of radiative
accelerations. Fingering mixing is included, using a prescription that comes
from 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Other parameter-dependent turbulent mixing
processes are also considered. A global mass loss is also implemented. When no
mass loss is considered, the observed abundances of Sc are rather in favour of
the models whose superficial layers are fully mixed down to the iron
accumulation zone, although other mixing prescriptions are also able to
reproduce the observations for the most massive model presented here ($2.0
M_\odot$). The models including mass loss with rates in the range of
$[10^{-13};10^{-14}] M_\odot$/yr are compatible with some of the observations,
while other observations suggest that the mass-loss rate could be lower. The
constraints brought by the modelling of Sc are consistent with those derived
using other chemical elements.
