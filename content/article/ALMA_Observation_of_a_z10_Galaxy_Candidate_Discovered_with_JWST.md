 We report ALMA observation of a $z\gtrsim10$ galaxy candidate (GHZ1)
discovered from the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. Our ALMA program
aims to detect the [OIII] emission line at the rest-frame 3393.0062 GHz
($88.36\mu$m) and far-IR continuum emission with the spectral window setup
seamlessly covering 26.125 GHz frequency range ($10.10<z<11.14$). A total of 7
hours of on-source integration was employed, using four frequency settings to
cover the full range (1.7 hours per setting), with 0.7" angular resolution. No
line or continuum is clearly detected, with a 5$\sigma$ limit to the line
emission of 0.4 mJy beam$^{-1}$ at 150 km s$^{-1}$ channel$^{-1}$, and to the
continuum emission of 30$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. We report marginal spectral and
continuum features ($4.4\sigma$ and $2.6\sigma$ peak signal-to-noise ratio,
respectively), within 0.17" of the JWST position of GHZ1. These features with
an implication of a spectroscopic redshift of $z=10.38$, need to be verified
with further observation. Assuming that the best photometric redshift estimate
($z=10.60^{+0.52}_{-0.60}$) is correct, the broadband galaxy spectral energy
distribution model for the $3\sigma$ upper limit of the continuum flux from
GHZ1 suggests that GHZ1 might have low dust temperature ($T_d<30$K). The
$5\sigma$ upper limit of [OIII] line luminosity and the star formation rate
estimate with large error, are consistent with the properties of low
metallicity galaxies and those of local starburst galaxies. We also report
clear detections of continuum emission from six galaxies in the field with the
JWST counterparts.
