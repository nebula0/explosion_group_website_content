 Double radio lobes are generally believed to be produced by active nuclei of
elliptical galaxies. However, several double-lobed radio sources have been
solidly found to be associated with spiral galaxies. By cross-matching
$\sim9\times10^5$ spiral galaxies selected from the SDSS DR8 data with the full
1.4-GHz radio source catalogs of NVSS and FIRST, we identify three new spiral
galaxies: J0326$-$0623, J1110+0321 and J1134+3046 that produce double radio
lobes, in addition to five double-lobed spirals previously known. By combining
the newly discovered and all the other known cases in literature, we find that
most of these spiral galaxies are located in a galaxy group or a poor cluster,
in which the environment is denser than in the field, and about half of them
are the central brightest galaxies in their parent system. We therefore suggest
that the environment is one of the key factors for a spiral to produce double
radio lobes.
