 We present 65 extremely dust-obscured galaxies from the UltraVISTA DR3 survey
of the COSMOS field at $1<z<4$. In contrast to other studies of dusty galaxies,
we select our sample based on dust attenuation measured by UV-MIR spectral
energy distribution (SED) modeling that allows for extreme attenuation levels.
We construct our sample by making cuts at $1 \le z \le 4$, A$_V \ge 3$, and
log(M$_*$/M$_\odot$)$ \ge 10.5$. This method reliably selects galaxies
exhibiting independent indicators of significant dust content, including FIR
detection rates. We perform panchromatic SED modeling with matched $Herschel$
photometry and find stellar and dust properties that differ from typical
sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG) samples as well as $Herschel$ sources matched in
redshift and stellar mass. Our sources have lower star formation rates and
higher A$_V$ than SMGs, but comparable total IR luminosities. Most of our
sample falls on or near the star-forming main sequence for this redshift range.
Finally, we perform a morphological analysis with GALFIT using the $K_S$-band
images and $Hubble$ $F814W$ and $F160W$ imaging when available. Typical axis
ratios of $\sim 0.4$ suggest disk-like morphology for the majority of our
sources, and we note only three apparent merging systems. Our sample generally
agrees with the size-mass relation for star-forming galaxies, with a tail
extending to smaller sizes. We conclude that the most heavily obscured galaxies
in this redshift range share many characteristics with typical star-forming
galaxies, forming a population of dusty galaxies that overlaps, but is not
encompassed by, those selected through dust emission.
