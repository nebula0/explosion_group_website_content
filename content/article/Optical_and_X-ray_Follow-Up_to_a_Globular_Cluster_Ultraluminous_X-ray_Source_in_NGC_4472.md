 NGC 4472 is home to five ultraluminous X-ray sources hosted by globular
clusters. These sources have been suggested as good black hole candidates in
extragalactic globular clusters$-$ a highly sought after population that may
provide observational information regarding the progenitors of merging black
hole binaries. In this body of work, we present X-ray and optical follow up to
one of these sources, CXOUJ1229410+075744 (GCU1). We find no evidence of [OIII]
optical emission in GCU1 which indicates a lack of significant evidence for
super-Eddington outflows, unlike what is seen in a handful of ULXs in
extragalactic GCs. X-ray monitoring from 2019-2021 shows no detected X-ray
emission above a few $\times$ $10^{38}$ erg/s. Comparisons of the
multi-wavelength properties to disc-dominated, near Eddington Galactic black
hole low mass X-ray binaries (GRS 1915+105 and XTEJ1817-330) suggests that GCU1
may show similar behaviour to GRS 1915+105 in terms of X-ray variability and
similar relationships between $L_X$ and $kT$, with GCU1 showing maximum X-ray
luminosities one order of magnitude higher.
