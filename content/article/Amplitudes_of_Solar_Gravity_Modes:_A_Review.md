 Solar gravity modes are considered as the {\it Rosetta Stone} for probing and
subsequently deciphering the physical properties of the solar inner-most
layers. Recent claims of positive detection therefore shed some new light on
the long-standing issue of estimating solar gravity mode amplitudes. In this
article, our objective is to review the theoretical efforts intended to predict
solar gravity mode amplitudes. Because most of these studies assumed analogous
driving and damping properties to those for the observed acoustic modes, we
also provide a short overview of our current knowledge for these modes in the
Sun and solar-type stars (which show solar-like oscillations) before diving
into the specific problem of solar gravity modes. Finally, taking recent
estimates into account, we conclude and confirm that the low-frequency domain
(typically between $10\,\mu$Hz and $100\,\mu$Hz) is certainly more suited to
focus on for detecting solar gravity modes. More precisely, around $60\,\mu$Hz,
the theoretical estimates are slightly lower than the observational detection
threshold as provided by the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies)
instrument by about a factor of two only. This is typically within the current
uncertainties associated with theoretical estimates and should motivate us for
improving our knowledge on turbulence in the whole solar convective region,
which is key for improving the accuracy of $g$-mode amplitude estimates. The
recent detection of solar inertial modes (Gizon et al. 2021) combined with the
continuous development of numerical simulations provide interesting prospects
for future studies.
