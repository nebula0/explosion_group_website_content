 Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of stellar explosions whose
progenitor systems are not yet well determined. We present and analyze
observations of the Type Ibn SN 2019kbj, and model its light curve in order to
constrain its progenitor and explosion parameters. SN 2019kbj shows roughly
constant temperature during the first month after peak, indicating a power
source (likely CSM interaction) that keeps the continuum emission hot at
~15000K. Indeed, we find that the radioactive decay of Ni56 is disfavored as
the sole power source of the bolometric light curve. A radioactive decay +
circumstellar-material (CSM) interaction model, on the other hand, does
reproduce the bolometric emission well. The fits prefer a uniform-density CSM
shell rather than CSM due to a steady mass-loss wind, similar to what is seen
in other Type Ibn SNe. The uniform-density CSM shell model requires ~0.1 solar
masses of Ni56 and ~1 solar mass of total ejecta to reproduce the light curve.
SN 2019kbj differs in this manner from another Type Ibn SN with derived
physical parameters, SN 2019uo, for which an order of magnitude lower Ni56 mass
and larger ejecta mass were derived. This points towards a possible diversity
in SN Ibn progenitor systems and explosions.
