 We report the identification of a set of old super metal-rich dwarf stars
with orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galactic
plane between ~0.5-1.5 kpc. We discuss their properties to understand their
origins. We use data from the internal data release 6 of the Gaia-ESO Survey.
We selected stars observed at high resolution with abundances of 21 species of
18 individual elements. We apply hierarchical clustering to group the stars
with similar chemical abundances within the complete chemical abundance space.
According to their chemical properties, this set of super metal-rich stars can
be arranged into five subgroups. Four seem to follow a chemical enrichment
flow, where nearly all abundances increase in lockstep with Fe. The fifth
subgroup shows different chemical characteristics. All subgroups have the
following features: median ages of the order of 7-9 Gyr, Solar or sub-Solar
[Mg/Fe] ratios, maximum height between 0.5-1.5 kpc, low eccentricities, and a
detachment from the expected metallicity gradient with guiding radius. The high
metallicity of our stars is incompatible with a formation in the Solar
neighbourhood. Their dynamic properties agree with theoretical expectations
that these stars travelled from the inner Galaxy due to blurring and, most
importantly, to churning. We suggest that most of this population's stars
originated in the Milky Way's inner regions (inner disc and/or the bulge) and
later migrated to the Solar neighbourhood. The region from where the stars
originated had a complex chemical enrichment history, with contributions from
supernovae types Ia and II and possibly asymptotic giant branch stars.
