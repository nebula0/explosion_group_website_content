 We investigate the main tensions within the current standard model of
cosmology from the perspective of the void size function in BOSS DR12 data. For
this purpose, we present the first cosmological constraints on the parameters
$S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ and $H_0$ obtained from voids as
a stand-alone probe. We rely on an extension of the popular volume-conserving
model for the void size function, tailored to the application on data,
including geometric and dynamic distortions. We calibrate the two nuisance
parameters of this model with the official BOSS collaboration mock catalogs and
propagate their uncertainty through the statistical analysis of the BOSS void
number counts. We focus our analysis on the $\Omega_{\rm m}$--$\sigma_8$ and
$\Omega_{\rm m}$--$H_0$ parameter planes and derive the marginalized
constraints $S_8 = 0.78^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ and $H_0=65.2^{+4.5}_{-3.6}$
$\mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1} \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our estimate of $S_8$ is
fully compatible with constraints from the literature, while our $H_0$ value
slightly disagrees by more than $1\sigma$ with recent local distance ladder
measurements of type Ia supernovae. Our results open up a new viewing angle on
the rising cosmological tensions and are expected to improve notably in
precision when jointly analyzed with independent probes.
