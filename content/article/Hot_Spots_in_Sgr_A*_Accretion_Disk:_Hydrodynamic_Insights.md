 The recent image of our galaxy's supermassive black hole Sgr A* derived from
the 7 April 2017 data of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration shows
multiple hot spots in its accretion disk. Using the analytical framework, we
demonstrate that the observed hot spots may not be disjoint elements but
causally linked components ("petals") of one rotating quasi-stationary
macro-structure formed in the thermo-vorticial field within the accretion disk.
