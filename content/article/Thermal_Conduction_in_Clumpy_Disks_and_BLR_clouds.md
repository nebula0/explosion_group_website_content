 We investigate the dynamics of clumps that coexisted with/in
advection-dominated accretion flows by considering thermal conductivity.
Thermal conduction can be one of the effective factors in the energy
transportation of ADAFs; hence it may indirectly affect the dynamics of clumps
by means of a contact force between them and their host medium. We first study
the ensemble of clumps by assuming them as collision-less particles and
secondly we find the orbital motion of these clouds as individuals. For both
parts, clumps are subject to the gravity of the central object and a drag
force. The strong coupling between clumps and ADAF leads to equality between
the average treatment of the clumps and the dynamics of their background. By
employing the collision-less Boltzmann equation we calculate the velocity
dispersion of the clumps which turns out approximately one order of magnitude
higher than the ADAF. In fact, involving drag force in such a system causes the
angular momentum of the clumps can be transported outwards by the ADAF, and
hence the clouds eventually will be captured at the tidal radius. The results
show that the presence of thermal conduction increases the root of the averaged
radial velocity square and this in turn speeds up the process of capturing the
clouds through the tidal force. In the end, we focus on a typical individual
cloud, the spiral orbits appear thanks to only the toroidal component of
friction force. The parametric study again proves that the operation of thermal
conduction helps for decreasing the lifetime of clumps.
