 Context: Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are divided into slow and fast rotators
(FRs and SRs) according to the degree of ordered rotation of their stellar
populations. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations indicate that galaxies are
formed as FRs before their rotational support decreases, usually because of
mergers. Aims: We aimed to investigate this process observationally for
galaxies outside of clusters. Methods: We made use of the fact that different
merger types leave different traces that have different lifetimes. We
statistically analyzed multiple characteristics of galaxies that are expected
to be influenced by mergers: tidal features, kinematically distinct cores,
stellar age, etc. They were taken from the MATLAS and \atlas databases. We
identified through multilinear regression the quantities that, at a fixed mass
and environmental density of the galaxy, significantly correlate with a measure
of the ordered rotation of the galaxy, \rotsup. Results: We found a negative
correlation of the rotational support with the occurrence of tidal disturbances
and kinematic substructures and a positive correlation with metallicity and
metallicity gradients. For massive galaxies, the rotational support correlates
negatively with the abundance of alpha elements, and for the galaxies in
low-density environments, it correlates negatively with the central photometric
cuspiness. These and additional literature observational constraints are
explained the easiest if the mergers that decreased the rotational support of
ETGs were typically minor, wet and happening at $z\approx 2$. They did not form
the currently observed tidal features. The observed frequency of tidal features
implies a merging rate of 0.07-0.2 per Gyr. This is insufficient for explaining
the observed growth of radii of ETGs with redshift by mergers.
