 In November 2019 we began operating FLEET (Finding Luminous and Exotic
Extragalactic Transients), a machine learning algorithm designed to
photometrically identify Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) in transient
alert streams. Using FLEET, we spectroscopically classified 21 of the 50 SLSNe
identified worldwide between November 2019 and January 2022. Based on our
original algorithm, we anticipated that FLEET would achieve a purity of about
50\% for transients with a probability of being a SLSN, \pslsn$>0.5$; the true
on-sky purity we obtained is closer to 80\%. Similarly, we anticipated FLEET
could reach a completeness of about 30\%, and we indeed measure an upper limit
on the completeness of $\approx 33$\%. Here, we present FLEET 2.0, an updated
version of FLEET trained on 4,780 transients (almost 3 times more than in FLEET
1.0). FLEET 2.0 has a similar predicted purity to FLEET 1.0, but outperforms
FLEET 1.0 in terms of completeness, which is now closer to $\approx 40$\% for
transients with \pslsn$>0.5$. Additionally, we explore possible systematics
that might arise from the use of FLEET for target selection. We find that the
population of SLSNe recovered by FLEET is mostly indistinguishable from the
overall SLSN population, in terms of physical and most observational
parameters. We provide FLEET as an open source package on GitHub
