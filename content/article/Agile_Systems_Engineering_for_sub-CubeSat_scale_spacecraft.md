 Space systems miniaturization has been increasingly popular for the past
decades, with over 1600 CubeSats and 300 sub-CubeSat sized spacecraft estimated
to have been launched since 1998. This trend towards decreasing size enables
the execution of unprecedented missions in terms of quantity, cost and
development time, allowing for massively distributed satellite networks, and
rapid prototyping of space equipment. Pocket-sized spacecraft can be designed
in-house in less than a year and can reach weights of less than 10g, reducing
the considerable effort typically associated with orbital flight. However,
while Systems Engineering methodologies have been proposed for missions down to
CubeSat size, there is still a gap regarding design approaches for
picosatellites and smaller spacecraft, which can exploit their potential for
iterative and accelerated development. In this paper, we propose a Systems
Engineering methodology that abstains from the classic waterfall-like approach
in favor of agile practices, focusing on available capabilities, delivery of
features and design "sprints". Our method, originating from the software
engineering disciplines, allows quick adaptation to imposed constraints,
changes to requirements and unexpected events (e.g. chip shortages or delays),
by making the design flexible to well-defined modifications. Two femtosatellite
missions, currently under development and due to be launched in 2023, are used
as case studies for our approach, showing how miniature spacecraft can be
designed, developed and qualified from scratch in 6 months or less. We claim
that the proposed method can simultaneously increase confidence in the design
and decrease turnaround time for extremely small satellites, allowing
unprecedented missions to take shape without the overhead traditionally
associated with sending cutting-edge hardware to space.
