 The galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) is a dominant source of systematics in
weak lensing (WL) studies. In this paper, by employing large simulations with
semi-analytical galaxy formation, we investigate the IA effects on WL peak
statistics. Different simulated source galaxy samples of different redshift
distributions are constructed, where both WL shear and IA signals are included.
Convergence reconstruction and peak statistics are then performed for these
samples. Our results show that the IA effects on peak abundances mainly consist
of two aspects. One is the additional contribution from IA to the shape noise.
The other is from the satellite IA that can affect the peak signals from their
host clusters significantly. The latter depends on the level of inclusion in a
shear sample of the satellite galaxies of the clusters that contribute to WL
peaks, and thus is sensitive to the redshift distribution of source galaxies.
We pay particular attention to satellite IA and adjust it artificially in the
simulations to analyze the dependence of the satellite IA impacts on its
strength. This information can potentially be incorporated into the modeling of
WL peak abundances, especially for high peaks physically originated from
massive clusters of galaxies, and thus to mitigate the IA systematics on the
cosmological constraints derived from WL peaks.
