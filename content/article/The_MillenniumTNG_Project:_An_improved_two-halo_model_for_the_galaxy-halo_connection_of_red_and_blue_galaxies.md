 Approximate methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies are of great
utility to large galaxy surveys. However, the limitations of simple halo
occupation models (HODs) preclude a full use of small-scale galaxy clustering
data and call for more sophisticated models. We study two galaxy populations,
luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and star-forming emission-line galaxies (ELGs), at
two epochs, $z=1$ and $z=0$, in the large volume, high-resolution
hydrodynamical simulation of the MillenniumTNG project. In a partner study we
concentrated on the small-scale, one-halo regime down to $r\sim 0.1{\rm
Mpc}/h$, while here we focus on modeling galaxy assembly bias in the two-halo
regime, $r\gtrsim 1{\rm Mpc}/h$. Interestingly, the ELG signal exhibits scale
dependence out to relatively large scales ($r\sim 20{\rm Mpc}/h$), implying
that the linear bias approximation for this tracer is invalid on these scales,
contrary to common assumptions. The 10-15\% discrepancy present in the standard
halo model prescription is only reconciled when we augment our halo occupation
model with a dependence on extrinsic halo properties ("shear" being the
best-performing one) rather than intrinsic ones (e.g., concentration, peak
mass). We argue that this fact constitutes evidence for two-halo galaxy
conformity. Including tertiary assembly bias (i.e. a property beyond mass and
"shear") is not an essential requirement for reconciling the galaxy assembly
bias signal of LRGs, but the combination of external and internal properties is
beneficial for recovering ELG the clustering. We find that centrals in low-mass
haloes dominate the assembly bias signal of both populations. Finally, we
explore the predictions of our model for higher-order statistics such as
nearest-neighbor counts. The latter supplies additional information about
galaxy assembly bias and can be used to break degeneracies between halo model
parameters.
