 We use the most recent data release (DR9) of the DESI legacy imaging survey
and SDSS galaxy groups to measure the conditional luminosity function (CLF) for
groups with halo mass $M_{\rm h}\ge 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and redshift $0.01\le
z\le 0.08$, down to a limiting $r$-band magnitude of $M_{\rm r}=-10\sim-12$.
For a given halo mass we measure the CLF for the total satellite population, as
well as separately for the red and blue populations classified using the
$(g-z)$ color. We find a clear faint-end upturn in the CLF of red satellites,
with a slope $\alpha\approx-1.8$ which is almost independent of halo mass. This
faint-end upturn is not seen for blue satellites and for the total population.
Our stellar population synthesis modeling shows that the $(g-z)$ color provides
a clean red/blue division, and that group galaxies in the red population
defined by $(g-z)$ are all dominated by old stellar populations. The fraction
of old galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity shows a minimum at a
luminosity $M_{\rm r}\sim-18$, corresponding to a stellar mass
$M_\ast\sim10^{9.5}M_\odot$. This mass scale is independent of halo mass and is
comparable to the characteristic luminosity at which galaxies show a dichotomy
in surface brightness and size, suggesting that the dichotomy in the old
fraction and in galaxy structure may have a common origin. The rising of the
old fraction at the faint end for Milky Way (MW)-sized halos found here is in
good agreement with the quenched fraction measured both for the MW/M31 system
and from the ELVES survey. We discuss the implications of our results for the
formation and evolution of low-mass galaxies, and for the stellar mass
functions of low-mass galaxies to be observed at high redshift.
