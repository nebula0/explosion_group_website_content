 The nonlinear Lagrangian displacement field and initial linear density field
are highly correlated. Therefore, reconstructing the nonlinear displacement
field could better extract the primordial cosmological information from the
late time density field. Continuing from Ref. [1], we investigate to what
extent the iterative displacement reconstruction in Ref. [2] can recover the
true displacement field with a particular emphasis on improving the numerical
discreteness effect and improving the perturbation theory model for the
postreconstructed field. We propose two new displacement field estimators to
overcome the numerical discreteness effect in measuring the displacement field;
the normalized momentum estimator (NME) and the rescaled resumed estimator
(RRE). Furthermore, by adequately accounting for the UV-sensitive term in a
reconstruction procedure with an effective field theory approach, we manage to
decrease the discrepancy between the theoretical model and the simulation
result almost five times, to the level of a few \% at $k\sim 0.2h/{\rm Mpc}$
for the redshift $z=0.6$. We conclude that the previous displacement field
reconstruction cannot fully reconstruct the shape of the nonlinear displacement
field at $k\sim 0.2h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0.6$, while it is still an efficient BAO
reconstruction method.
