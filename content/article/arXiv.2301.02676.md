        Around 400 million years after the big bang, ultraviolet emission (Lyman Continuum, LyC) from star-forming galaxies drove the reionization of the Universe. How this radiation escapes the cold neutral gas (HI) of galaxies with sufficiently little absorption to reionize the intergalactic medium is poorly understood. HI has never been mapped in confirmed LyC-emitters, leaving major uncertainties on how LyC photons escape galaxies and ionize the intergalactic medium. We imaged the 21cm HI emission of nearby reionization-era analog galaxy Haro 11 to identify how ionizing radiation escapes the neutral interstellar medium. We find that merger-driven interactions have tidally displaced up to 82% of the neutral gas from the ultraviolet emission production sites in the galaxy, allowing the escape of ionizing radiation to the intergalactic medium. Increased galaxy interactions in the early Universe predicted by cosmological models could contribute significantly to the reionization of the Universe.
