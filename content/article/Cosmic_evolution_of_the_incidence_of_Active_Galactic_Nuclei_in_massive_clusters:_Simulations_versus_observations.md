 This paper explores the role of small-scale environment ($<1$ Mpc) in
modulating accretion events onto supermassive black holes by studying the
incidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in massive clusters of galaxies. A
flexible, data-driven semi-empirical model is developed based on a minimal set
of parameters and under the zero order assumption that the incidence of AGN in
galaxies is independent of environment. This is used to predict how the
fraction of X-ray selected AGN among galaxies in massive dark matter halos
($\gtrsim 3\times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$) evolves with redshift and reveal
tensions with observations. At high redshift, $z\sim1.2$, the model
underpredicts AGN fractions, particularly at high X-ray luminosities, $L_X(\rm
2-10\,keV) \gtrsim 10^{44}\, erg \, s^{-1}$. At low redshift, $z\sim0.2$, the
model estimates fractions of moderate luminosity AGN ($L_X(\rm 2-10\,keV)
\gtrsim 10^{43}\, erg \, s^{-1}$) that are a factor of $2-3$ higher than the
observations. These findings reject the zero order assumption on which the
semi-empirical model hinges and point to a strong and redshift-dependent
influence of the small-scale environment on the growth of black holes. Cluster
of galaxies appear to promote AGN activity relative to the model expectation at
$z\sim1.2$ and suppress it close to the present day. These trends could be
explained by the increasing gas content of galaxies toward higher redshift
combined with an efficient triggering of AGN at earlier times in galaxies that
fall onto clusters.
