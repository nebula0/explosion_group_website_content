 We examine the migration of luminous low-mass cores in laminar protoplanetary
discs where accretion occurs mainly because of disc winds and where the planet
luminosity is generated by pebble accretion. Using 2D hydrodynamical
simulations, we determine the eccentricities induced by thermal forces as a
function of gas and pebble accretion rates, and also evaluate the importance of
the torque exerted by the solid component relative to the gas torque. For a gas
accretion rate $\dot M= 2\times 10^{-8}$ $M_\odot/$yr and pebble flux $\dot
M_{peb}=170$ $M_\oplus$/Myr, we find that embryo eccentricities attain values
comparable to the disc aspect ratio. The planet radial excursion in the disc,
however, causes the torque exerted by inflowing pebbles to cancel on average
and migration to transition from outward to inward. This is found to arise
because the magnitude of thermal torques decreases exponentially with
increasing eccentricity, and we provide a fitting formula for the thermal
torque attenuation as a function of eccentricity. As the disc evolves, the
accretion luminosity becomes at some point too small to make the core
eccentricity grow such that the solid component can exert a non-zero torque on
the planet. This torque is positive and for gas accretion rates $\dot M
\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}$ $M_\odot/$yr and pebble fluxes $\dot M_{peb} \lesssim
120$ $M_\oplus/$Myr, it is found to overcome the gas torque exerted on cores
with mass $m_p\lesssim$ $1M_\oplus$, resulting in outward migration.
