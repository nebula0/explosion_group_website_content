 Mergers are thought to be a fundamental channel for galaxy growth, perturbing
the gas dynamics and the magnetic fields (B-fields) in the interstellar medium
(ISM). However, the mechanisms that amplify and dissipate B-fields during a
merger remain unclear. We characterize the morphology of the ordered B-fields
in the multi-phase ISM of the closest merger of two spiral galaxies, the
Antennae galaxies. We compare the inferred B-fields using $154~\mu$m thermal
dust and $11$ cm radio synchrotron emission polarimetric observations. We find
that the $154~\mu$m B-fields are more ordered across the Antennae galaxies than
the $11$ cm B-fields. The turbulent-to-ordered $154~\mu$m B-field increases at
the galaxy cores and star-forming regions. The relic spiral arm has an ordered
spiral $154~\mu$m B-field, while the $11$ cm B-field is radial. The $154~\mu$m
B-field may be dominated by turbulent dynamos with high $^{12}$CO(1-0) velocity
dispersion driven by star-forming regions, while the $11$ cm B-field is
cospatial with high HI velocity dispersion driven by galaxy interaction. This
result shows the dissociation between the warm gas mainly disturbed by the
merger, and the dense gas still following the dynamics of the relic spiral arm.
We find a $\sim8.9$ kpc scale ordered B-field connecting the two galaxies. The
base of the tidal tail is cospatial with the HI and $^{12}$CO(1-0) emission and
has compressed and/or sheared $154~\mu$m and $11$ cm B-fields driven by the
merger. We suggest that amplify B-fields, with respect to the rest of the
system and other spiral galaxies, may be supporting the gas flow between both
galaxies and the tidal tail.
