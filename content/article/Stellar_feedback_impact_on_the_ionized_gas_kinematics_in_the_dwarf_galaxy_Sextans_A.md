 Feedback from massive stars shapes the ISM and affects the evolution of
galaxies, but its mechanisms acting at the small scales ($\sim 10$ pc) are
still not well constrained observationally, especially in the low-metallicity
environments. We present the analysis of the ionized gas (focusing on its
kinematics, which were never studied before), and its connection to the massive
stars in the nearby ($D \sim 1.4$ Mpc) star-forming very metal-poor ($Z\sim
0.07 Z_\odot$) galaxy Sextans A. The analysis is based on the observations with
a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer, long-slit spectroscopy and imaging in
emission lines with narrow-band tunable filters. We found 10 expanding
superbubbles of ionized gas with ages of 1-3 Myr. We argue that 3 of them are
probable supernovae remnants, while the pre-supernovae feedback is an important
source of energy for blowing-out the remaining superbubbles. The two brightest
sites of star formation exhibit signs of outflowing ionized gas, which is
traced by its ionized and atomic gas kinematics and (in one case) by its
emission line flux ratios. Overall, the ionized gas kinematics in Sextans A is
highly affected by the feedback from several generations of massive stars and
inconsistent with the mere solid-body rotation observed in atomic hydrogen.
