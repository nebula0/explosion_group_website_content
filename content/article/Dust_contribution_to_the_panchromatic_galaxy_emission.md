 We have developed a pipeline called \mentari to generate the far-ultraviolet
to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies from the
\dustysage semi-analytic galaxy formation model (SAM). \dustysage incorporates
dust-related processes directly on top of the basic ingredients of galaxy
formation like gas infall, cooling, star formation, feedback, and mergers. We
derive a physically motivated attenuation model from the computed dust
properties in \dustysage, so each galaxy has a self-consistent set of
attenuation parameters based on the complicated dust physics that occurred
across the galaxy's assembly history. Then, we explore several dust emission
templates to produce infrared spectra. Our results show that a
physically-motivated attenuation model is better for obtaining a consistent
multi-wavelength description of galaxy formation and evolution, compared to
using a constant attenuation. We compare our predictions with a compilation of
observations and find that the fiducial model is in reasonable agreement with:
(i) the observed $z=0$ luminosity functions from the far-ultraviolet to
far-infrared simultaneously, and hence (ii) the local cosmic SED in the same
range, (iii) the rest-frame K-band luminosity function across $0 < z < 3$, and
(iv) the rest-frame far-ultraviolet luminosity function across $0 < z < 1$. Our
model underproduces the far-ultraviolet emission at $z=2$ and $z=3$, which can
be improved by altering the AGN feedback and dust processes in \dustysage.
However, this combination thus worses the agreement at $z=0$, which suggests
that more detailed treatment of such processes is required.
