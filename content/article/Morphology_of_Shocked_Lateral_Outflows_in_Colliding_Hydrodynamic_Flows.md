 Supersonic interacting flows occurring in phenomena such as protostellar jets
give rise to strong shocks, and have been demonstrated in several laboratory
experiments. To study such colliding flows, we use the AstroBEAR AMR code to
conduct hydrodynamic simulations in three dimensions. We introduce variations
in the flow parameters of density, velocity, and cross sectional radius of the
colliding flows %radius in order to study the propagation and conical shape of
the bow shock formed by collisions between two, not necessarily symmetric,
hypersonic flows. We find that the motion of the interaction region is driven
by imbalances in ram pressure between the two flows, while the conical
structure of the bow shock is a result of shocked lateral outflows (SLOs) being
deflected from the horizontal when the flows are of differing cross-section.
