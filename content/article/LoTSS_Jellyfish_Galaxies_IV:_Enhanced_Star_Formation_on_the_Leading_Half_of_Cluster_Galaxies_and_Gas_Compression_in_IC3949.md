 With MaNGA integral field spectroscopy, we present a resolved analysis of
star formation for 29 jellyfish galaxies in nearby clusters, identified from
radio continuum imaging taken by the Low Frequency Array. Simulations predict
enhanced star formation on the "leading half" of galaxies undergoing ram
pressure stripping, and in this work we report observational evidence for this
elevated star formation. The dividing line (through the galaxy center) that
maximizes this star formation enhancement is systematically tied to the
observed direction of the ram pressure stripped tail, suggesting a physical
connection between ram pressure and this star formation enhancement. We also
present a case study on the distribution of molecular gas in one jellyfish
galaxy from our sample, IC3949, using ALMA CO J=1-0, HCN J=1-0, and HCO$^+$
J=1-0 observations from the ALMaQUEST survey. The $\mathrm{H_2}$ depletion time
(as traced by CO) in IC3949 ranges from $\sim\!1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ in the
outskirts of the molecular gas disk to $\sim\!11\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ near the galaxy
center. IC3949 shows a clear region of enhanced star formation on the leading
half of the galaxy where the average depletion time is
$\sim\!2.7\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, in line with the median value for the galaxy on the
whole. Dense gas tracers, HCN and HCO$^+$, are only detected at the galaxy
center and on the leading half of IC3949. Our results favour a scenario in
which ram pressure compresses the interstellar medium, promoting the formation
of molecular gas that in turn fuels a localized increase of star formation.
