 We present a data-driven technique to analyze multi-frequency images from
upcoming cosmological surveys mapping large sky area. Using full information
from the data at the two-point level, our method can simultaneously constrain
the large-scale structure (LSS), the spectra and redshift distribution of
emitting sources, and the noise in observed data without any prior assumptions
beyond the homogeneity and isotropy of cosmological perturbations. In
particular, the method does not rely on source detection or photometric or
spectroscopic redshift estimates. Here we present the formalism and demonstrate
our technique with a mock observation from nine optical and near-infrared
photometric bands. Our method can recover the input signal and noise without
bias, and quantify the uncertainty on the constraints. Our technique provides a
flexible framework to analyze the large-scale structure observation traced by
different types of sources, which has potential for wide application to the
current or future cosmological datasets such as SPHEREx, Rubin Observatory,
Euclid, or the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
