 With a unique set of 54 overlapping narrow-band and two broader filters
covering the entire optical range, the incoming Javalambre-Physics of the
Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) will provide a great
opportunity for stellar physics and near-field cosmology. In this work, we use
the miniJPAS data in 56 J-PAS filters and 4 complementary SDSS-like filters to
explore and prove the potential of the J-PAS filter system in characterizing
stars and deriving their atmospheric parameters. We obtain estimates for the
effective temperature with a good precision (<150 K) from spectral energy
distribution fitting. We have constructed the metallicity-dependent stellar
loci in 59 colours for the miniJPAS FGK dwarf stars, after correcting certain
systematic errors in flat-fielding. The very blue colours, including uJAVA-r,
J0378-r, J0390-r, uJPAS-r, show the strongest metallicity dependence, around
0.25 mag/dex. The sensitivities decrease to about 0.1 mag/dex for the J0400-r,
J0410-r, and J0420-r colours. The locus fitting residuals show peaks at the
J0390, J0430, J0510, and J0520 filters, suggesting that individual elemental
abundances such as [Ca/Fe], [C/Fe], and [Mg/Fe] can also be determined from the
J-PAS photometry. Via stellar loci, we have achieved a typical metallicity
precision of 0.1 dex. The miniJPAS filters also demonstrate strong potential in
discriminating dwarfs and giants, particularly the J0520 and J0510 filters. Our
results demonstrate the power of the J-PAS filter system in stellar parameter
determinations and the huge potential of the coming J-PAS survey in stellar and
Galactic studies.
