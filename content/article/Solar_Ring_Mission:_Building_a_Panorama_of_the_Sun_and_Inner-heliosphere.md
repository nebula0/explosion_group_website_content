 Solar Ring (SOR) is a proposed space science mission to monitor and study the
Sun and inner heliosphere from a full 360{\deg} perspective in the ecliptic
plane. It will deploy three 120{\deg}-separated spacecraft on the 1-AU orbit.
The first spacecraft, S1, locates 30{\deg} upstream of the Earth, the second,
S2, 90{\deg} downstream, and the third, S3, completes the configuration. This
design with necessary science instruments, e.g., the Doppler-velocity and
vector magnetic field imager, wide-angle coronagraph, and in-situ instruments,
will allow us to establish many unprecedented capabilities: (1) provide
simultaneous Doppler-velocity observations of the whole solar surface to
understand the deep interior, (2) provide vector magnetograms of the whole
photosphere - the inner boundary of the solar atmosphere and heliosphere, (3)
provide the information of the whole lifetime evolution of solar featured
structures, and (4) provide the whole view of solar transients and space
weather in the inner heliosphere. With these capabilities, Solar Ring mission
aims to address outstanding questions about the origin of solar cycle, the
origin of solar eruptions and the origin of extreme space weather events. The
successful accomplishment of the mission will construct a panorama of the Sun
and inner-heliosphere, and therefore advance our understanding of the star and
the space environment that holds our life.
