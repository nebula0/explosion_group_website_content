 Our goal is to determine, with high accuracy, the physical and orbital
parameters of two double-lined eclipsing binary systems, where the components
are two giant stars. We also aim to study the evolutionary status of the
binaries, to derive the distances towards them by using a surface
brightness-colour relation, and to compare these measurements with the
measurements presented by the Gaia mission. In order to measure the physical
and orbital parameters of the systems, we analysed the light curves and
radial-velocity curves with the Wilson-Devinney code. We used V band and I-band
photometry from the OGLE catalogue and near-infrared photometry obtained with
the New Technology Telescope (NTT) equipped with the SOFI instrument. The
spectroscopic data were collected with the HARPS spectrograph mounted at the
ESO 3.6m telescope and the MIKE spectrograph mounted at the 6.5m Clay
telescope. We present the first analysis of this kind for two evolved eclipsing
binary systems from the OGLE catalogue: OGLE-BLG-ECL-305487 and
OGLE-BLG-ECL-116218. The masses of the components of OGLE-BLG-ECL-305487 are
$M_1$ = 1.059 $\pm$ 0.019 and $M_2$ = 0.991 $\pm$ 0.018 $M_\odot$, and the
radii are $R_1$ = 19.27 $\pm$ 0.28 and $R_2$ = 29.99 $\pm$ 0.24 R$_\odot$. For
OGLE-BLG-ECL-116218, the masses are $M_1$= 0.969 $\pm$ 0.012 and $M_2$= 0.983
$\pm$ 0.012 $M_\odot$, while the radii are $R_1$= 16.73 $\pm$ 0.28 and $R_2$=
22.06 $\pm$ 0.26 $R_\odot$. The evolutionary status of the systems is discussed
based on the PARSEC and MIST isochrones. The ages of the systems were
established to be between 7.3-10.9 Gyr for OGLE-BLG-ECL-305487 and around 10
Gyr for OGLE-BLG-ECL-116218. We also measured the distances to the binaries.
For OGLE-BLG-ECL-305487, $d$= 7.80 $\pm$ 0.18 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.19 (syst.) kpc
and for OGLE-BLG-ECL-116218, $d$= 7.57 $\pm$ 0.28 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.19 (syst.)
kpc.
