 IRAS23226-3843 has previously been classified as a changing-look AGN based on
X-ray and optical spectral variations. In 2019, Swift observations revealed a
strong rebrightening in X-ray and UV fluxes in comparison to observations in
2017. We took follow-up Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations together
with optical spectra (SALT and SAAO 1.9m telescope) from 2019 until 2021.
IRAS23226-3843 showed a strong X-ray and optical outburst in 2019. It varied in
the X-ray and optical continuum by a factor of 5 and 1.6, respectively, within
two months. This corresponds to a factor of 3 in the optical after correction
for the host galaxy contribution. The Balmer and FeII emission-line intensities
showed comparable variability amplitudes. The Halpha profiles changed from a
blue-peaked profile in the years 1997 and 1999 to a broad double-peaked profile
in 2017 and 2019. However, there were no major profile variations in the
extremely broad double-peaked profiles despite the strong intensity variations
in 2019. One year after the outburst, the optical spectral type changed and
became a Seyfert type 2 in 2020. Blue outflow components are present in the
Balmer lines and in the Fe band in the X-rays. A deep broadband
XMM-Newton/NuSTAR spectrum was taken during the maximum state in 2019. This
spectrum is qualitatively very similar to a spectrum taken in 2017, but by a
factor of 10 higher. The soft X-ray band appears featureless. The soft excess
is well modeled with a Comptonization model. A broadband fit with a power-law
continuum, Comptonized soft excess, and Galactic absorption gives a good fit to
the combined EPIC-pn and NuSTAR spectrum. In addition, we see a complex and
broadened Fe K emission-line profile in the X-rays. The changing-look character
in IRAS23226-3843 is most probably caused by changes in the accretion rate --
based on the short-term variations on timescales of weeks to months.
