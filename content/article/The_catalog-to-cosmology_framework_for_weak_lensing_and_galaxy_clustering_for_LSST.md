 We present TXPipe, a modular, automated and reproducible pipeline for
generating data vectors in cosmology analyses. The pipeline is developed within
the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy
Science Collaboration (DESC), and designed for cosmology analyses using LSST
data. In this paper, we present the pipeline for the so-called 3$\times$2pt
analysis - a combination of three two-point functions that measure the auto-
and cross-correlation between galaxy density and shapes. We perform the
analysis both in real and harmonic space using TXPipe and other LSST-DESC
tools. We validate the pipeline using Gaussian simulations and show that the
pipeline accurately measures data vectors and recovers the input cosmology to
the accuracy level required for the first year of LSST data. We also apply the
pipeline to a realistic mock galaxy sample extracted from the CosmoDC2
simulation suite Korytov et al. (2019). TXPipe establishes a baseline framework
that can be built upon as the LSST survey proceeds. Furthermore, the pipeline
is designed to be easily extended to science probes beyond the 3$\times$2pt
analysis.
