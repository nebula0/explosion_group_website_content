 It has been well established in the local universe that galaxy properties
differ based on the large-scale environment in which they reside. As luminous
Lyman-alpha nebulae have been shown to trace overdense environments at z~2-3,
comparing the properties of galaxies within Lyman-alpha nebulae systems to
those in the field can provide insight into how and when locally-observed
trends between galaxy properties and environment emerged. Six Lyman-alpha
nebulae were discovered at z~2.3 in a blind search of the GOODS-S extragalactic
field, a region also covered by the 3D-HST spectroscopic survey. Utilizing
3D-HST data, we identified 86 galaxies in the vicinity of these nebulae and
used statistical tests to compare their physical properties to galaxies
elsewhere in the field. Galaxies lying within 320 proper kpc of a Lyman-alpha
nebula are roughly half a magnitude brighter than those in the field, with
higher stellar masses, higher star formation rates, and larger effective radii.
Even when considering the effects of sample incompleteness, our study suggests
that galaxies in overdensities at z~2.3 traced by Lyman-alpha nebulae are being
influenced by their environment. Furthermore, Lyman-alpha nebula-associated
galaxies lie on the same main sequence of star formation as field galaxies, but
have a larger proportion of high-mass galaxies, consistent with the idea that
galaxy evolution is accelerated in rich environments. Expanded surveys for
Lyman-alpha nebulae in other deep extragalactic fields and galaxy spectroscopic
follow-up with JWST will better constrain the demographics of Lyman-alpha
nebula-associated galaxies.
