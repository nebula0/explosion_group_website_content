 We report the detection of a high density of redshift $z\approx 10$ galaxies
behind the foreground cluster Abell 2744, selected from imaging data obtained
recently with NIRCam onboard JWST by three programs -- GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, and
DDT-2756. To ensure robust estimates of the lensing magnification $\mu$, we use
an improved version of our model that exploits the first epoch of NIRCam images
and newly obtained MUSE spectra, and avoids regions with $\mu>5$ where the
uncertainty may be higher. We detect seven bright $z\approx 10$ galaxies with
demagnified rest-frame $-22 \lesssim M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -19$ mag, over an area
of $\sim37$ sq. arcmin. Taking into account photometric incompleteness and the
effects of lensing on luminosity and cosmological volume, we find that the
density of $z\approx 10$ galaxies in the field is about $10\times$ ($3\times$)
larger than the average at $M_{UV}\approx -21 (-20)$ mag reported so far. The
density is even higher when considering only the GLASS-JWST data, which are the
depeest and the least affected by magnification and incompleteness. The
GLASS-JWST field contains 5 out of 7 galaxies, distributed along an apparent
filamentary structure of 2 Mpc in projected length, and includes a close pair
of candidates with $M_{\rm UV}< -20$ mag having a projected separation of only
16 kpc. These findings suggest the presence of a $z\approx 10$ overdensity in
the field. In addition to providing excellent targets for efficient
spectroscopic follow-up observations, our study confirms the high density of
bright galaxies observed in early JWST observations, but calls for multiple
surveys along independent lines of sight to achieve an unbiased estimate of
their average density and a first estimate of their clustering.
