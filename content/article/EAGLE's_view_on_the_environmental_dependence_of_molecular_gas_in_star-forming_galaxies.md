 ${\rm H}_2$ detections are usually biased towards star-forming galaxies,
whose low number statistics in clusters has led to contradictory results in the
literature regarding the impact of environment on their ${\rm H}_2$ content,
across redshifts. In this work, we employ the EAGLE simulation to investigate
the relationship between the ${\rm H}_2$ content of star-forming galaxies and
their environment for redshifts spanning $0\leq z\leq 1$. To do so, we divide
the sample into those that are bound to clusters and those that are not. We
find that, at any given redshift, the galaxies in clusters generally have lower
${\rm H}_2$content than their non-cluster counterparts with the same stellar
mass (corresponding to an offset of $\lesssim 0.5$ dex), but this offset is
virtually absent at $M_\star\lesssim10^{9.3}~{\rm M}_\odot$. Tracking the
galaxies back in time reveals that the deficit of ${\rm H}_2$ in cluster
galaxies relative to non-cluster galaxies is not due to intrinsic differences
in their stellar or active galactic nuclei feedback, but rather a result of a
sharp drop in the ${\rm H}_2$ content of cluster galaxies after infall into
their host halo; the longer the time since infall, the greater the deficit.
Based on the histories of particles associated with our galaxies, the drop is
attributed to lack of replenishment, depletion due to star formation, and gas
escaping the galaxies in cluster environments. These results provide support
and theoretical insights for existing molecular gas observations that show a
deficit of ${\rm H}_2$ content for cluster galaxies, and provide predictions
for future surveys.
