 Next-generation spectroscopic surveys such as the MegaMapper, MUltiplexed
Survey Telescope (MUST), MaunaKea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE), and Wide
Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) are foreseen to increase the number of
galaxy/quasar redshifts by an order of magnitude, with hundred millions of
spectra that will be measured at $z>2$. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis for
these surveys on the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the redshift-space
distortion (RSD) measurement, the non-Gaussianity amplitude $f_{\rm NL}$, and
the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$. For BAO and RSD parameters, these surveys may
achieve precision at sub-percent level (<0.5 per cent), representing an
improvement of factor 10 w.r.t. the latest database. For NG, these surveys may
reach an accuracy of $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})\sim 1$. They can also put a tight
constraint on $M_\nu$ with $\sigma(M_\nu) \sim 0.02\,\rm eV$ if we do joint
analysis with Planck and even $ 0.01\,\rm eV$ if combined with other data. In
addition, we introduce a general survey model, to derive the cosmic volume and
number density of tracers, given instrumental facilities and survey strategy.
Using our Fisher formalism, we can explore (continuously) a wide range of
survey observational parameters, and propose different survey strategies that
optimise the cosmological constraints. Fixing the fibre number and survey
duration, we show that the best strategy for $f_{\rm NL}$ and $M_\nu$
measurement is to observe large volumes, despite the noise increase. However,
the strategy differs for the apparent magnitude limit. Finally, we prove that
increasing the fibre number improves $M_{\nu}$ measurement but not
significantly $f_{\rm NL}$.
