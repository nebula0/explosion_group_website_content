 To date, over 500 short-period rocky planets with equilibrium temperatures
above 1500 K have been discovered. Such planets are expected to support magma
oceans, providing a direct interface between the interior and atmosphere. This
provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into their interior compositions
through atmospheric observations. A key process in doing such work is the vapor
outgassing from the lava surface. LavAtmos is an open-source code that
calculates the equilibrium chemical composition of vapor above a melt for a
given composition and temperature. Results show that the produced output is in
good agreement with the partial pressures obtained from experimental laboratory
data as well as with other similar codes from literature. LavAtmos allows for
the modeling of vaporisation of a wide range of different mantle compositions
of hot-rocky exoplanets. In combination with atmospheric chemistry codes, this
enables the characterization of interior compositions through atmospheric
signatures.
