 More and more experiments have identified that the energy spectra of both
primary and secondary cosmic-rays exhibit a hardening above $\sim 200$ GV. Most
recently, the DAMPE experiment has reported a hardening of boron-to-carbon
ratio at $200$ GV. These signs call for modifications of the conventional
cosmic-ray (CR) picture. In this work, we propose that the plethoric secondary
cosmic rays, for example, boron, antiprotons, originate from the hadronic
interactions of freshly accelerated cosmic rays with the interstellar gas near
the sources. We find that secondary-to-primary ratios, for example,
boron-to-carbon, boron-to-oxygen and antiproton-to-proton ratios, could be well
described. The measurements of electrons and positrons could also be accounted
for.
