 Local early-type galaxies with directly-measured black hole masses, $M_{\rm
bh}$, have been reported to represent a biased sample relative to the
population at large. Such galaxies with Spitzer Space Telescope imaging have
been purported to possess velocity dispersions, $\sigma$, at least $\sim$0.1
dex larger for a given galaxy stellar mass, $M_{\rm *,gal}$, than is typically
observed among thousands of early-type galaxies imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. This apparent offset led Shankar et al. to reduce the normalisation of
the observed $M_{\rm bh} \propto \sigma^5$ relation by at least $\sim$0.5 dex
to give their "intrinsic relations", including $\sigma$-based modifications to
the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm *,gal}$ relation. These modifications were based on
the untested assumption that the stellar masses had been derived consistently
between the two samples. Here, we provide the necessary check using galaxies
common to the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the stellar masses of galaxies
with and without directly measured black holes had appeared offset from each
other due to the use of inconsistent stellar mass-to-light ratios,
$\Upsilon_*$, for the optical and infrared data. We briefly discuss the
"intrinsic relations" and why some of these will at times appear to have had
partial success when applied to data based on similarly inconsistent values of
$\Upsilon_*$. Finally, we reiterate the importance of the $\upsilon$
(lower-case $\Upsilon$) term, which we previously introduced into the $M_{\rm
bh}$-$M_{\rm *}$ relations to help avoid $\Upsilon_*$-related mismatches.
