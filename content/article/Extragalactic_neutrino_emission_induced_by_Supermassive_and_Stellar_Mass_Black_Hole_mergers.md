 The recent detections of binary stellar mass black hole mergers by the LIGO
and Virgo Collaborations suggest that such mergers are common occurrences.
Galaxy mergers further indicate that supermassive black holes in centers of
galaxies also merge and are typically expected to have had at least one merger
in their lifetime, possibly many. In the presence of a jet, these mergers are
almost always accompanied by a change of the jet direction and a connected jet
precession motion, leading to interactions of the jet with ambient matter and
producing very high-energy particles, and consequently high-energy gamma-rays
and neutrinos. In this work, we investigate the possibility under which
conditions such mergers could be the sources of the diffuse astrophysical
neutrino flux measured by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The main free
parameters in the calculation concern the frequency of the mergers and the
fraction of energy that is transferred from the gravitationally released energy
to neutrinos. We show that the merger rate for SMBBHs must lie between $\sim
10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The ratio of energy going to
neutrinos during such mergers lies then between $\sim 10^{-6} - 3\cdot
10^{-4}$. For stellar mass BBH mergers, the rate needs to be $\sim 10-100$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and the expected ratio of neutrino to gravitational wave
energy lies in a comparable range as for SMBBHs, $\sim 2 \cdot 10^{-5} -
10^{-3}$. These values lie in a reasonable parameter range, so that the
production of neutrinos at the level of the detected neutrino flux is a
realistic possibility.
