 We present the first analysis of photometric observations of the supernova
(SN) impostor AT 2016blu located in the galaxy NGC 4559. This transient source
was discovered by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search in January 2012 and has
continued its eruptive variability since then. Photometry of AT 2016blu reveals
at least 19 outbursts in 2012-2022. AT 2016blu's outbursts show irregular
variability with multiple closely spaced peaks of varying brightness. While the
individual outbursts have irregular light curves, concentrations of these peaks
seem to repeat with a period of roughly 110-115 d. Based on this period, the
next outburst of AT 2016blu should occur around February 2023. AT 2016blu
shares some similarities with SN 2000ch in NGC 3432, where it has been proposed
that brightening episodes are caused by violent encounters at periastron in a
binary system containing a luminous blue variable (LBV). We propose that AT
2016blu outbursts are also driven by binary interactions that intensify around
times of periastron in an eccentric system. The intrinsic variability of the
LBV-like primary star may cause different intensity and duration of binary
interaction at each periastron passage. The binary interaction of AT 2016blu
also resembles the periastron encounters of $\eta$ Carinae leading up to its
Great Eruption and the erratic pre-SN eruptions of SN 2009ip. This similarity
suggests that AT 2016blu might also be headed for a catastrophe, making it a
target of great interest.
