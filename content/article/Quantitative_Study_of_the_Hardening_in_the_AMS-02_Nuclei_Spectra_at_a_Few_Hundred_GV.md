 The most significant feature in the cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei spectra is the
spectral hardening at a few hundred GV. Whether the hardening of the different
nuclei species are same or not is important for constructing CR source and
propagation models. In this work, we collect the latest released AMS-02 CR
nuclei spectra of primary species (proton, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon,
magnesium, silicon, and iron), secondary species (lithium, beryllium, boron,
and fluorine), and hybrid species (nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum), and study
the break positions and the spectral index differences (less and greater than
the break rigidity) of the spectral hardening quantitatively. The results show
us that the CR nuclei spectral hardening at a few hundred GV has hybrid
origins. In detail, the dominating factors of the spectral hardening for
primary and secondary CR nuclei species are different: the former comes from
the superposition of different kinds of CR sources, while the latter comes from
the propagation process. Both of these factors influence all kinds of CR nuclei
spectra, just with different weights.
