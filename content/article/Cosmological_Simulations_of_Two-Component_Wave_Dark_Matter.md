 Wave (fuzzy) dark matter consists of ultralight bosons ($m \sim 10^{-22}
\textrm{--} 10^{-20}\,{\rm eV}$), featuring a compact solitonic core at the
centre of a granular halo. Here we extend this model to a two-component wave
dark matter, with distinct particle masses and coupled only through gravity,
and investigate the resulting soliton-halo structure via cosmological
simulations. Specifically, we assume wave dark matter contains $75$ per cent
major component and $25$ per cent minor component, fix the major-component
particle mass to $m_{\rm major}=1\times10^{-22}\,{\rm eV}$, and explore two
different minor-component particle masses with $m_{\rm major}:m_{\rm
minor}=3:1$ and $1:3$, respectively. For $m_{\rm major}:m_{\rm minor}=3:1$, we
find that (i) the major- and minor-component solitons coexist, have comparable
masses, and are roughly concentric. (ii) The soliton peak density is
significantly lower than the single-component counterpart, leading to a much
smoother soliton-to-halo transition and rotation curve. (iii) The combined
soliton mass of both components follows the same single-component core-halo
mass relation. In dramatic contrast, for $m_{\rm major}:m_{\rm minor}=1:3$, we
find that a minor-component soliton cannot form with the presence of a stable
major-component soliton; the total density profile, for both halo and soliton,
is thus dominated by the major component and closely follows the
single-component case. To support this finding, we propose a toy model to
illustrate that it is difficult to form a soliton in a hot environment
associated with a deep gravitational potential. The work demonstrates the extra
flexibility added to the multi-component wave dark matter model is capable of
resolving observational tensions over the single-component model while
retaining key features of the single-component model.
