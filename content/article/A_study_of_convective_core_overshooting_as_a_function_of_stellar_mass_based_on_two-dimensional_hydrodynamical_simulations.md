 We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of core convection for
zero-age-main-sequence stars covering a mass range from 3 $M_\odot$ to 20
$M_\odot$. The simulations are performed with the fully compressible
time-implicit code MUSIC. We study the efficiency of overshooting, which
describes the ballistic process of convective flows crossing a convective
boundary, as a function of stellar mass and luminosity. We also study the
impact of artificially increasing the stellar luminosity for 3 $M_\odot$
models. The simulations cover hundreds to thousands of convective turnover
timescales. Applying the framework of extreme plume events previously developed
for convective envelopes, we derive overshooting lengths as a function of
stellar masses. We find that the overshooting distance ($d_{\rm ov}$) scales
with the stellar luminosity ($L$) and the convective core radius ($r_{\rm
conv}$). We derive a scaling law $d_{\rm ov} \propto L^{1/3} r_{\rm
conv}^{1/2}$ which is implemented in a 1D stellar evolution code and the
resulting stellar models are compared to observations. The scaling predicts
values for the overshooting distance that significantly increase with stellar
mass, in qualitative agreement with observations. Quantitatively, however, the
predicted values are underestimated for masses $\gtrsim 10 M_\odot$. Our 2D
simulations show the formation of a nearly-adiabatic layer just above the
Schwarzschild boundary of the convective core, as exhibited in recent 3D
simulations of convection. The most luminous models show a growth in size with
time of the nearly-adiabatic layer. This growth seems to slow down as the upper
edge of the nearly-adiabatic layer gets closer to the maximum overshooting
length and as the simulation time exceeds the typical thermal diffusive
timescale in the overshooting layer.
