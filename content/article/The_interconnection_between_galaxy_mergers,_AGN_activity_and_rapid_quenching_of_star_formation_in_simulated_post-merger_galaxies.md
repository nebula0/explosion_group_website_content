 We investigate the role of galaxy mergers on supermassive black hole (SMBH)
accretion and star formation quenching in three state-of-the-art cosmological
simulations with contrasting physics models: EAGLE, Illustris and IllustrisTNG.
We find that recently coalesced 'post-mergers' in all three simulations have
elevated SMBH accretion rates by factors of ~2-5. However, rapid (within 500
Myr of coalescence) quenching of star formation is rare, with incidence rates
of 0.4% in Illustris, 4.5% in EAGLE and 10% in IllustrisTNG. The rarity of
quenching in post-mergers results from substantial gas reservoirs that remain
intact after the merger. The post-mergers that do successfully quench tend to
be those that had both low pre-merger gas fractions as well as those that
experience the largest gas losses. Although rare, the recently quenched
fraction of post-mergers is still elevated compared to a control sample of
non-mergers by factors of two in IllustrisTNG and 11 in EAGLE. Conversely,
quenching is rarer in Illustris post-mergers than in their control. Recent
observational results by Ellison et al. have found rapid quenching to be at
least 30 times more common in post-mergers, a significantly higher excess than
found in any of the simulations. Our results, therefore, indicate that whilst
merger-induced SMBH accretion is a widespread prediction of the simulations,
its link to quenching depends sensitively on the physics models, and that none
of the subgrid models of the simulations studied here can fully capture the
connection between mergers and rapid quenching seen in observations.
