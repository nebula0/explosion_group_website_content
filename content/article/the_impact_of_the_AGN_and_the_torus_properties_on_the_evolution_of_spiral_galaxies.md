 For spiral galaxies, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and some physical
parameters that concern the host galaxy such as spiral arm radius and density
can play an important role in the morphological evolution of these galaxies.
Considering the gravitational effect of the central black hole as a feeding
mechanism, the gas flows from spiral arms to the accretion disk. Accordingly,
we constructed our approach and derived an equation for the AGN luminosity that
depends on parameters such as the black hole mass and the spiral arm density.
The galaxy samples were taken from a catalog of type 1 AGN from SDSS-DR7. In
our model, we present the relation between the AGN luminosity and the black
hole mass depending on the above physical parameters. We also investigated the
relation between the black hole mass and the star formation rate for the galaxy
sample. The physical properties of the torus, such as the spiral arm radius,
density, the torus length, and the gas mass, and the star formation rate, were
explained in terms of the variation of the AGN luminosity. These properties are
more effective in the evolutionary scenario of the spiral galaxy. Relative to
the variation of the AGN luminosity, the evolutionary track is different based
quantitatively on the star formation rate. In which the variation in the star
formation rate is positively correlated with the AGN luminosity.
