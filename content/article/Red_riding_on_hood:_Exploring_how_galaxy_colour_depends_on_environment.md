 Galaxy populations are known to exhibit a strong colour bimodality,
corresponding to blue star-forming and red quiescent subpopulations. The
relative abundance of the two populations has been found to vary with stellar
mass and environment. In this paper, we explore the effect of environment
considering different types of measurements. We choose a sample of 49, 911
galaxie with $0.05 < z < 0.18$ from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey. We
study the dependence of the fraction of red galaxies on different measures of
the local environment as well as the large-scale "geometric" environment
arXiv:1412.2141 [astro-ph.CO] defined by density gradients in the surrounding
cosmic web. We find that the red galaxy fraction varies with the environment
independently of stellar mass. The local environmental measures exhibit a
larger variation in red fraction from lower to higher density, as compared to
the geometric environment. By comparing the different environmental densities
pairwise, we show that no density measurement fully explains the observed
environmental red fraction variation, suggesting the different densities
contain different information. We test whether the local environmental
measures, when combined together, can explain all the observed environmental
red fraction variation. The geometric environment has a small residual effect,
and this effect is larger for voids than any other type of geometric
environment. This could provide a test of the physics applied to
cosmological-scale galaxy evolution simulations as it combines large-scale
effects with local environmental impact.
