 We probe how common extremely rapid rotation is among massive stars in the
early universe by measuring the OBe star fraction in nearby metal-poor dwarf
galaxies. We apply a new method that uses broad-band photometry to measure the
galaxy-wide OBe star fractions in the Magellanic Clouds and three more distant,
more metal-poor dwarf galaxies. We find OBe star fractions of ~20% in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (0.5 Z_Solar), and ~30% in the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.2
Z_Solar) as well as in the so-far unexplored metallicity range from 0.1 Z_solar
to 0.2 Z_solar occupied by the other three dwarf galaxies. Our results imply
that extremely rapid rotation is common among massive stars in metal-poor
environments such as the early universe.
