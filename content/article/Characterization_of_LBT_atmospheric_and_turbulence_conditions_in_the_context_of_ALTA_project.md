 ALTA project has been active since 2016, providing, at LBT observatory site,
forecasts of atmospheric parameters, such as temperature, wind speed and
direction, relative humidity and precipitable water vapor, and optical
turbulence parameters, such as seeing, wavefront coherence time and isoplanatic
angle with the final goal to support nightly the science operation of the LBT.
Besides to the forecasts, during the years ALTA has been collecting statistics
on the atmospheric conditions which can be used to draw a very accurate
characterization of the climatology of the telescope site located on top of
Mount Graham, Arizona. Such characterization can be used both for the
optimization and calibration of the forecast model and as a reference for a
model validation. The climatology of these parameters is conceived to be a
further output of ALTA that will be upgraded on the website with time and it
will be able to put in evidence trends at short as well as long time scales. In
this contribution we present a climatological description of all the
atmospheric parameters relevant for ground-based astronomy in order to provide
to the scientific community a robust reference of the bserving conditions at
LBT. The study is performed using on-site measurements provided by DIMM and
atmospheric sensors over several years and made available in the telescope
telemetry data.
