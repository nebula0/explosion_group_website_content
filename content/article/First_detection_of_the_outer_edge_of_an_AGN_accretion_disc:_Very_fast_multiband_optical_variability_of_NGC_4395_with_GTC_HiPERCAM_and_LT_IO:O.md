 We present fast (~200s sampling) ugriz photometry of the low mass AGN NGC
4395 with the Liverpool Telescope, followed by very fast (3s sampling) us, gs,
rs, is and zs simultaneous monitoring with HiPERCAM on the 10.4m GTC. These
observations provide the fastest ever AGN multiband photometry and very precise
lag measurements. Unlike in all other AGN, gs lags us by a large amount,
consistent with disc reprocessing but not with reprocessing in the Broad Line
Region (BLR). There is very little increase in lag with wavelength at long
wavelengths, indicating an outer edge (Rout) to the reprocessor. We have
compared truncated disc reprocessing models to the combined HiPERCAM and
previous X-ray/UV lags. For the normally accepted mass of 3.6E5 solar, we
obtain reasonable agreement with zero spin, Rout ~1700 Rg, and the DONE
physically-motivated temperature-dependent disc colour correction factor
(fcol). A smaller mass of 4E4 solar can only be accomodated if fcol=2.4, which
is probably unrealistically high. Disc self gravity is probably unimportant in
this low mass AGN but an obscuring wind may provide an edge. For the small mass
the dust sublimation radius is similar to Rout, so the wind could be dusty.
However for the more likely large mass the sublimation radius is further out so
the optically-thick base of a line-driven gaseous wind is more likely. The
inner edge of the BLR is close to Rout in both cases. These observations
provide the first good evidence for a truncated AGN disc and caution that
truncation should be included in reverberation lag modelling.
