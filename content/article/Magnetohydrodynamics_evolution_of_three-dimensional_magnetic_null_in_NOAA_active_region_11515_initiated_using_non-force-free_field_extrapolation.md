 Magnetohydrodynamics simulation of active region NOAA 11515 is performed to
examine the initiation of the M5.6 flaring event that starts around 10:43 UT on
2012 July 2. The simulation is conducted using an extrapolated non-force-free
magnetic field generated from the photospheric vector magnetogram of the active
region as the initial magnetic field. The magnetic field shows the presence of
a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null with the corresponding dome overlying a
filament and a low-lying magnetic flux rope, observed in 304~\AA~ and 131~\AA~
respectively.
  The simulated dynamics, triggered by the initial Lorentz force, lead to the
bifurcations of the flux rope, which is similar to the observed bifurcation in
the 131 \AA~ brightenings. Additionally, the rope exhibits a rise and
reconnects at the 3D null. These reconnections convert field lines of the rope
into the anchored outer spine of the 3D null -- explaining the occurrence of a
nearby confined C-class flare. Further, the results show that the field lines
of the flux rope reach the vicinity of the filament and become non-parallel to
the field lines of the filament. This initiates the reconnections between the
rope and the field lines of the filament -- activating the filament for the
eruption. This interesting interaction of the flux rope and filament seems to
contribute to the onset of the M-class flare.
