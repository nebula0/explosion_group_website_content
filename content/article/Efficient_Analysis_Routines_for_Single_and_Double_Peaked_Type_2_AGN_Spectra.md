 Driven by the imminent need to rapidly process and classify millions of AGN
spectra drawn from next generation astronomical facilities, we present a
spectral fitting routine for Type 2 AGN spectra optimised for high volume
processing, using the Quasar Spectral Fitting library (QSFit). We analyse an
optically selected sample of 813 luminous Type 2 AGN spectra at $z < 0.83$ from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to qualify its performance. We report a
median narrow line H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ Balmer decrement of 4.5$\pm$0.8, alluding
to the presence of dust in the narrow line region (NLR). We publish a
specialised QSFit fitting routine for high signal to noise ratio spectra and
general fitting routine for double peaked Type 2 AGN spectra applied on a
sub-sample of 45 spectra from our parent sample. We report a median red and
blue peak velocity separation of 390$\pm$60kms$^{-1}$. No trend is found for
red or blue peaks to exhibit systematically different luminosity or ionization
properties. Emission line diagnostics show that the double peaks in all sources
are illuminated by an AGN-powered ionizing continuum. Finally, we examine the
morphology of host galaxies of our double peaked sample. We find double peaked
Type 2 AGN reside in merging systems at a comparable frequency to single peaked
AGN. This suggests that the double peaked AGN phenomenon is likely to have a
bi-conical outflow origin in the majority of cases. We publicly release the
code used for spectral analysis and produced catalogues used in this work.
