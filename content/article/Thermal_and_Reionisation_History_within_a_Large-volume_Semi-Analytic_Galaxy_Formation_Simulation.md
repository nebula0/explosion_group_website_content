 We predict the 21-cm global signal and power spectra during the Epoch of
Reionisation using the MERAXES semi-analytic galaxy formation and reionisation
model, updated to include X-ray heating and thermal evolution of the
intergalactic medium. Studying the formation and evolution of galaxies together
with the reionisation of cosmic hydrogen using semi-analytic models (such as
MERAXES) requires N-body simulations within large volumes and high mass
resolutions. For this, we use a simulation of side-length $210$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc
with $4320^3$ particles resolving dark matter haloes to masses of $5\times10^8$
$h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$. To reach the mass resolution of atomically cooled galaxies,
thought the dominant population contributing to reionisation, at $z=20$ ($\sim
2\times10^7$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$) we augment this simulation using the
DARKFOREST Monte-Carlo merger tree algorithm to achieve an effective particle
count of $\sim10^{12}$. Using this augmented simulation we explore the impact
of mass resolution on the predicted reionisation history as well as the impact
of X-ray heating on the 21-cm global signal and the 21-cm power-spectra. We
also explore the cosmic variance of 21-cm statistics within $70^{3}$ $h^{-3}$
Mpc$^3$ sub-volumes. We find that the midpoint of reionisation varies by
$\Delta z\sim0.8$ and that the cosmic variance on the power spectrum is
underestimated by a factor of $2-4$ at $k\sim 0.1-0.4$ Mpc$^{-1}$ due to the
non-Gaussian signal. To our knowledge, this work represents the first model of
both reionisation and galaxy formation which resolves low-mass atomically
cooled galaxies while simultaneously sampling sufficiently large scales
necessary for exploring the effects of X-rays in the early Universe.
