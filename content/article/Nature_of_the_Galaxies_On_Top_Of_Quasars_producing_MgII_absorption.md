 Quasar-galaxy pairs at small separations are important probes of gas flows in
the disk-halo interface in galaxies. We study host galaxies of 198 MgII
absorbers at $0.39\le z_{abs}\le1.05$ that show detectable nebular emission
lines in the SDSS spectra. We report measurements of impact parameter (5.9$\le
D[kpc]\le$16.9) and absolute B-band magnitude ($-18.7\le {\rm M_B}\le -22.3$
mag) of host galaxies of 74 of these absorbers using multi-band images from the
DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, more than doubling the number of known host
galaxies with $D\le17$ kpc. This has allowed us to quantify the relationship
between MgII rest equivalent width($W_{2796}$) and D, with best-fit parameters
of $W_{2796}(D=0) = 3.44\pm 0.20$ Angstrom and an exponential scale length of
21.6$^{+2.41}_{-1.97}$ $kpc$. We find a significant anti-correlation between
$M_B$ and D, and $M_B$ and $W_{2796}$, consistent with the brighter galaxies
producing stronger MgII absorption. We use stacked images to detect average
emissions from galaxies in the full sample. Using these images and stacked
spectra, we derive the mean stellar mass ($9.4\le log(M_*/M_\odot) \le 9.8$),
star formation rate ($2.3\le{\rm SFR}[M_\odot yr^{-1}] \le 4.5$), age (2.5$-$4
Gyr), metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\sim$8.3) and ionization parameter (log~q[cm
s$^{-1}$]$\sim$ 7.7) for these galaxies. The average $M_*$ found is less
compared to those of MgII absorbers studied in the literature. The average SFR
and metallicity inferred are consistent with that expected in the main sequence
and the known stellar mass-metallicity relation, respectively. High spatial
resolution follow-up spectroscopic and imaging observations of this sample are
imperative for probing gas flows close to the star-forming regions of high-$z$
galaxies.
