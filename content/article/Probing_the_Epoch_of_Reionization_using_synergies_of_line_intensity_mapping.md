 The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) remains a poorly understood cosmic era for
the most part. Yet, efforts are still going on to probe and understand this
epoch. We present a review of the latest developments in the techniques
(especially line-intensity mapping) to study the EoR and try to highlight the
contribution of the Indian community in this field. Line-emissions like [H
I]$_{\rm 21cm}$, Lyman-$\alpha$, [C II]$_{\text{158}\mu\text{m}}$ and their
role as tracers in probing the EoR are discussed. While the [H I]$_{\rm 21cm}$
is an excellent probe of the early IGM, the others are mainly targeted to do an
unresolved and large-scale survey of the reionizing sources. Techniques to
model these signals include simulations and machine learning approaches, along
with the challenge to tackle foregrounds or interlopers. We also discuss
synergy opportunities among the various tracers that we mention. Synergy
addresses different aspects of the problem, which otherwise is difficult or
impossible to tackle. They include statistics like cross-power spectrum,
cross-bispectrum, and other techniques such as follow-up studies. We present
updates on the relevant experiments; these include the upper limits on the [H
I]$_{\rm 21cm}$ power spectrum, along with some highlights on high-redshift
galaxy surveys. Finally, we highlight what can be improved further within the
community: applying machine learning and simulations based on hydrodynamic and
radiative-transfer techniques. Next-generation experiments also need to be
conceived to address issues currently beyond our reach.
