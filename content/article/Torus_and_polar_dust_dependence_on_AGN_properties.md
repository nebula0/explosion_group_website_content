 We present a statistical analysis of the properties of the obscuring material
around active galactic nuclei (AGN). This study represents the first of its
kind for an ultra-hard X-ray (14-195keV; Swift/BAT) volume-limited (DL<40 Mpc)
sample of 24 Seyfert (Sy) galaxies (BCS40 sample) using high angular resolution
infrared data and various torus models: smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus
models and clumpy disc+wind models. We find that the smooth, clumpy and
two-phase torus models (i.e. without including the polar dusty wind component)
and disc+wind models provide best fits for a comparable number of galaxies,
8/24 (33.3%) and 9/24 (37.5%), respectively. We find that the best-fitted
models depend on the hydrogen column density (NH), which is related to the
X-ray (unobscured/obscured) and/or optical (Sy1/Sy2) classification. In
particular, smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus models best reproduce the
infrared (IR) emission of AGN with relatively high hydrogen column density
(median value of log (NH)=23.5+-0.8; i.e. Sy2). However, clumpy disc+wind
models provide the best fits to the nuclear IR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of Sy1/1.8/1.9 (median value of log (NH)=21.0+-1.0), specifically in the
near-IR (NIR) range. The success of the disc+wind models in fitting the NIR
emission of Sy1 galaxies is due to the combination of adding large graphite
grains to the dust composition and self-obscuration effects caused by the wind
at intermediate inclinations. In general, we find that the Seyfert galaxies
having unfavourable (favourable) conditions, i.e. nuclear hydrogen column
density and Eddington ratio, for launching IR dusty polar outflows are
best-fitted with smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus (disk+wind) models
confirming the predictions from simulations. Therefore, our results indicate
that the nature of the inner dusty structure in AGN depend on the intrinsic AGN
properties.
