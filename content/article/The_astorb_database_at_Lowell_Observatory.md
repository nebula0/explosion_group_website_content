 The astorb database at Lowell Observatory is an actively curated catalog of
all known asteroids in the Solar System. astorb has heritage dating back to the
1970's and has been publicly accessible since the 1990's. Beginning in 2015
work began to modernize the underlying database infrastructure, operational
software, and associated web applications. That effort has involved the
expansion of astorb to incorporate new data such as physical properties (e.g.
albedo, colors, spectral types) from a variety of sources. The data in astorb
are used to support a number of research tools hosted at
https://asteroid.lowell.edu. Here we present a full description of the software
tools, computational foundation, and data products upon which the astorb
ecosystem has been built.
