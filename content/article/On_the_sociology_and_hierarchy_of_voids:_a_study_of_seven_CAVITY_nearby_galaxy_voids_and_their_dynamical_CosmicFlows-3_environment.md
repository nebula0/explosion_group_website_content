 Context. The present study addresses a key question for our understanding of
the relation between void galaxies and their environment: the relationship
between luminous and dark matter in and around voids. Aims. To explore how
empty of matter local Universe voids are, we study the full (dark+luminous)
matter content of seven nearby cosmic voids that are fully contained within the
CosmicFlows-3 volume. Methods. The cosmic voids matter density profiles are
independently obtained using two different methods. They are built on one hand
from the galaxy redshift space 2 points-correlation function and, on the other
hand, using peculiar velocity gradients from the CosmicFlows-3 dataset.
Results. The results are noticeable since when using the redshift survey, all
voids show a radial positive gradient of galaxies, while based on the dynamical
analysis, only three of these voids display a clear underdensity of matter in
their center. Conclusions. It is the first time such a detailed observational
analysis of voids is conducted, showing that void emptiness should be derived
from dynamical information. Yet, from this limited study, the Hercules void is
the best candidate for a local Universe pure "pristine volume" expanding in 3
directions with no dark matter located in that void.
