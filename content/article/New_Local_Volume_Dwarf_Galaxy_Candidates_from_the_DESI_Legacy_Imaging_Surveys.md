 We undertook a search for new dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of relatively
isolated nearby galaxies with distances $D < 12$ Mpc and stellar masses in the
$2\times10^{11}-3\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ interval, using the data from the DESI
Legacy Imaging Surveys. Around the 46 considered Local Volume galaxies, $67$
new candidates for satellites of these galaxies were found. About half of them
are classified as spheroidal dwarfs of low surface brightness. The new galaxies
are included in the Local Volume database (LVGDB), which now contains 1421
objects, being 63% more than the Updated Nearby Galaxy Catalog.
