 The composition the atmosphere of Venus results from the integration of many
processes entering into play over the entire geological history of the planet.
Determining the elemental abundances and isotopic ratios of noble gases (He,
Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and stable isotopes (H, C, N, O, S) in the Venus atmosphere is
a high priority scientific target since it could open a window on the origin
and early evolution of the entire planet. This chapter provides an overview of
the existing dataset on noble gases and stable isotopes in the Venus
atmosphere. The current state of knowledge on the origin and early and
long-term evolution of the Venus atmosphere deduced from this dataset is
summarized. A list of persistent and new unsolved scientific questions stemming
from recent studies of planetary atmospheres (Venus, Earth and Mars) are
described. Important mission requirements pertaining to the measurement of
volatile elements in the atmosphere of Venus as well as potential technical
difficulties are outlined.
