 JWST high redshift galaxy observations predict a higher star formation
efficiency than the standard cosmology does, which poses a new tension to
$\Lambda$CDM. We find that the situation is worse than expected. The true
situation is that the Planck CMB measurement has a strong tension with JWST
high redshift galaxy observations. Specifically, we make a trial to alleviate
this tension by considering alternative cosmological models including dark
matter-baryon interaction, $f(R)$ gravity and dynamical dark energy. Within
current cosmological constraints from Planck-2018 CMB data, we find that these
models all fail to explain such a large tension. A possible scenario to escape
from cosmological constraints is the extended Press-Schechter formalism, where
we consider the local environmental effect on the early formation of massive
galaxies. Interestingly, we find that an appropriate value of nonlinear
environmental overdensity of a high redshift halo can well explain this
tension.
