 This work introduces new low-temperature gas opacities, in the range 3.2 <=
log(T/K) <= 4.5, computed with the AESOPUS code under the assumption of
thermodynamic equilibrium (Marigo &_Aringer_2009). In comparison to the
previous version AESOPUS 1.0, we updated and expanded molecular absorption to
include 80 species, mostly using the recommended line lists currently available
from the ExoMol and HITRAN databases. Furthermore, in light of a recent study,
we revised the H- photodetachment cross section, added the free-free absorption
of other negative ions of atoms and molecules, and updated the
collision-induced absorption due to H2/H2, H2/H, H2/He, and H/He pairs. Using
the new input physics, we computed tables of Rosseland mean opacities for
several scaled-solar chemical compositions, including Magg et al. (2022)'s most
recent one, as well as alpha-enhanced mixtures. The differences in opacity
between the new AESOPUS 2.0 and the original AESOPUS 1.0 versions, as well as
other sets of calculations, are discussed. The new opacities are released to
the community via a dedicated web-page that includes both pre-computed tables
for widely used chemical compositions, and a web-interface for calculating
opacities on-the-fly for any abundance distribution.
