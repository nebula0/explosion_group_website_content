 Following our previous study of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Inversion
(AIAI) of supernova analyses \citep{Xingzhuo2020AIAI}, we trained a set of deep
neural networks based on the one-dimensional radiative transfer code TARDIS
\citep{tardis} to simulate the optical spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia)
between 10 and 40 days after the explosion. The neural network can be applied
to derive the elemental abundances from the observed spectra. In this paper, we
focus on the mass of $^{56}$Ni and its associated spectral features for a
sample of 153 well-observed SNe~Ia. Many of the SNe have multi-epoch
observations for which the decay of the radioactive $^{56}$Ni can be tested
quantitatively. The $^{56}$Ni mass derived from AIAI using the observed spectra
as input for the sample is found to be in agreement with the theoretical
$^{56}$Ni decay rate. The AIAI reveals a spectral signature near 3890 \AA\
which can be identified as being produced by multiple Ni II lines between
$3950$ and $4100\ \AA$. The mass deduced from AIAI is found to be correlated to
the light-curve shapes of SNe~Ia, with the SNe~Ia with broader light curves
showing larger $^{56}$Ni mass in the envelope, further strengthening the
validity of the AIAI approach. AIAI enables spectral data of SNe to be
quantitatively analyzed under a given theoretical framework and provides
insights into the ejecta structure and explosion physics of SNe~Ia.
