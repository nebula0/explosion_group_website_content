 The fraction of ionizing photons escaping from galaxies, $f_{esc}$, is at the
same time a crucial parameter in modelling reionization and a very poorly known
quantity, especially at high redshift. Recent observations are starting to
constrain the values of $f_{esc}$ in low-z star-forming galaxies, but the
validity of this comparison remains to be verified. Applying at high-z the
empirical relation between $f_{esc}$ and the UV slope trends derived from the
Low-z Lyman Continuum Survey, we use the DELPHI semi-analytical galaxy
formation model to estimate the global ionizing emissivity of high-z galaxies,
which we use to compute the resulting reionization history. We find that both
the global ionizing emissivity and reionization history match the observational
constraints. Assuming that the low-z correlations hold during the epoch of
reionization, we find that galaxies with $-16 \lesssim M_{UV} \lesssim -13.5$
are the main drivers of reionization. We derive a population-averaged $\langle
f_{esc} \rangle \simeq 8\%, 10\%, 20\%$ at z=4.5, 6, 8.
