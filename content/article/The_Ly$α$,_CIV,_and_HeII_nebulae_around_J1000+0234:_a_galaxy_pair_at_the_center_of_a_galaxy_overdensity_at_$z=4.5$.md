 Ly$\alpha$ emission extending over $\gtrsim\,\rm 10\,kiloparsec\,(kpc)$
around dusty, massive starbursts at $z\gtrsim3$ might represent a short-lived
phase in the evolution of present-day, massive quiescent galaxies. To obtain
empirical constraints on this emerging scenario, we present Ly$\alpha$, CIV,
and HeII observations taken with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer towards
J1000$+$0234: a galaxy pair at $z=4.5$ composed of a low-mass starburst
(J1000$+$0234$-$South) neighboring a massive Submillimeter Galaxy (SMG;
J1000$+$0234$-$North) that harbors a rotationally supported gas disk. Based on
the spatial distribution and relative strength of Ly$\alpha$, CIV, and HeII, we
find that star formation in J1000+0234$-$South and an active galactic nucleus
in J1000+0234$-$North are dominant factors in driving the observed 40
kiloparsec-scale Ly$\alpha$ blob (LAB). We use the non-resonant HeII line to
infer kinematic information of the LAB. We find marginal evidence for two
spatially and spectrally separated HeII regions, which suggests that the
two-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile is mainly a result of two overlapping HI clouds
on a collision course, rather than resonant scattering effects in an expanding
HI shell. We also report the serendipitous identification of three Ly$\alpha$
emitters spanning over a redshift bin $\Delta z \leq 0.007$ (i.e., $\lesssim
380\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) located at $\lesssim 140\,\rm kpc$ from J1000+0234. A
galaxy overdensity analysis confirms that J1000+0234 lies near the center of a
Megaparsec-scale galaxy overdensity at $z= 4.5$ that might evolve into a galaxy
cluster at $z=0$. The properties of J1000+0234 and its large-scale environment
strengthen the link between SMGs within LABs, tracing overdense regions, as the
progenitors of local massive ellipticals in galaxy clusters.
