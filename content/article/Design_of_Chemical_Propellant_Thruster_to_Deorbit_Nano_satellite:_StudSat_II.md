 An increase in satellite application has skyrocketed the number of
satellites, especially in the low earth orbit (LEO). The major concern today is
that these satellites become debris after the end of life, negatively affecting
the space environment. As per the International Guidelines of the European
Space Agency, it is mandatory to deorbit the satellite within 25 years of its
end of life. This paper is aimed to design the solid chemical propellant
thruster to deorbit the StudSat II from its original orbit to the lower orbit.
StudSat II carries the heritage of StudSat I, successfully launched on 12th
July 2010 AD, and is the first Pico Satellite in India by the undergraduate
students of seven engineering colleges. This paper explains how a solid
monopropellant thruster could be used to deorbit the satellite after the end of
life with the least difficulty compared to other active and passive methods of
deorbiting. The deorbiting mechanism consists of a solid propellant, Convergent
Divergent nozzle, ignition system, and electronic actuators. The components of
the thruster were designed in the CATIA V5, and the combustion studies and flow
analysis were done in ANSYS. The concept of Hohmann transfer was used to
deorbit the satellite, and STK was used to simulate it.
