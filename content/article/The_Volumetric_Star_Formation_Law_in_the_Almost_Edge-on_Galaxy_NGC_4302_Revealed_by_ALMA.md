 We observe the almost edge-on (i $\sim$ 90 degrees) galaxy NGC 4302 using
ALMA (CO) and VLA (H I) to measure the gas disk thickness for investigating the
volumetric star formation law (SFL). The recent star formation rate (SFR) is
estimated based on a linear combination of IR 24 micron and H$\alpha$
emissions. The measured scale heights of CO and H I increase significantly with
radius. Using the scale heights along with the vertically integrated surface
densities, we derive the mid-plane volume densities of the gas ($\rho_{\rm
HI}$, $\rho_{\rm H_2}$, and $\rho_{\rm gas}$ = $\rho_{\rm HI}$+$\rho_{\rm
H_2}$) and the SFR ($\rho_{\rm SFR}$) and compare the volumetric SFL
($\rho_{\rm SFR} \propto \rho_{\rm gas}^n$) with the vertically integrated SFL
($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^N$). We find tight power-law
correlations between the SFR and the gas (H I, H$_2$, and the total gas) in
both volume and surface densities. The power-law indices of the total gas and H
I for the volumetric SFL are noticeably smaller than the indices for the
vertically integrated SFL while the H$_2$ indices for both cases are similar to
each other. In terms of the star formation efficiency (SFE), we find that the
molecular and total gas SFEs are roughly constant, while the atomic SFE is
clearly decreasing with radius in both cases.
