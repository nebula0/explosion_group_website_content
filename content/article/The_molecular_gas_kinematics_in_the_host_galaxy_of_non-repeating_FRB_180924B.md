 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients with large
dispersion measures. The origin of FRBs is still mysterious. One of the methods
to comprehend FRB origin is to probe the physical environments of FRB host
galaxies. Mapping molecular-gas kinematics in FRB host galaxies is critical
because it results in star formation that is likely connected to the birth of
FRB progenitors. However, most previous works of FRB host galaxies have focused
on its stellar component. Therefore, we, for the first time, report the
molecular gas kinematics in the host galaxy of the non-repeating FRB 180924B at
$z= 0.3216$. Two velocity components of the CO (3-2) emission line are detected
in its host galaxy with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA): the peak of one component ($-155.40$ km s$^{-1}$) is near the centre of
the host galaxy, and another ($-7.76$ km s$^{-1}$) is near the FRB position.
The CO (3-2) spectrum shows asymmetric profiles with A$_{\rm peak}$ $=2.03\pm
0.39$, where A$_{\rm peak}$ is the peak flux density ratio between the two
velocity components. The CO (3-2) velocity map also indicates an asymmetric
velocity gradient from $-180$ km s$^{-1}$ to 8 km s$^{-1}$. These results
indicate a disturbed kinetic structure of molecular gas in the host galaxy.
Such disturbed kinetic structures are reported for repeating FRB host galaxies
using HI emission lines in previous works. Our finding indicates that
non-repeating and repeating FRBs could commonly appear in disturbed kinetic
environments, suggesting a possible link between the gas kinematics and FRB
progenitors.
