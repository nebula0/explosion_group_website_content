 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is a Jupiter-family comet that was the target of
the Rosetta mission, the first mission to successfully orbit and land a probe
on a comet. This mission was accompanied by a large ground-based observing
campaign. We have developed a pipeline to calibrate and measure photometry of
comet 67P during its 2016 perihelion passage, making use of all visible
wavelength broadband imaging collected across a wide range of facilities. The
pipeline calibrates the brightness of the comet to a common photometric system
(Pan-STARRS 1) using background stars within the field allowing for compilation
and comparison of multiple data sets. Results follow the predictions based on
previous apparitions: 67P shows no obvious change in activity levels from
orbit-to-orbit and coma colours remain constant throughout the apparition. We
detected an outburst on 2015 August 22 of $\sim$0.14 mag. The brightness and
estimated mass of this outburst puts it in line with the outbursts directly
observed on the nucleus by Rosetta. An in situ outburst was observed at the
same time as the one seen from the ground, however linking these two events
directly remains challenging.
