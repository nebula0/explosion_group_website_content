 Cosmological N-body simulations of galaxies operate at the level of "star
particles" with a mass resolution on the scale of thousands of solar masses.
Turning these simulations into stellar mock catalogs requires "upsampling" the
star particles into individual stars following the same phase-space density. In
this paper, we demonstrate that normalizing flows provide a viable upsampling
method that greatly improves on conventionally-used kernel smoothing algorithms
such as EnBiD. We demonstrate our flow-based upsampling technique, dubbed
GalaxyFlow, on a neighborhood of the Solar location in two simulated galaxies:
Auriga 6 and h277. By eye, GalaxyFlow produces stellar distributions that are
smoother than EnBiD-based methods and more closely match the Gaia DR3 catalog.
For a quantitative comparison of generative model performance, we introduce a
novel multi-model classifier test. Using this classifier test, we show that
GalaxyFlow more accurately estimates the density of the underlying star
particles than previous methods.
