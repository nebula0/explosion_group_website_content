 In this VERTICO science paper we aim to study how the star formation process
depends on galactic environment and gravitational interactions in the context
of galaxy evolution. We explore the scaling relation between the star formation
rate (SFR) surface density and the molecular gas surface density, also known as
the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, in a subsample of Virgo cluster spiral
galaxies. We use new ACA and TP observations from the VERTICO-ALMA Large
Program at 720pc resolution to resolve the molecular gas content, as traced by
the 12CO(2-1) transition, across the disks of 37 spiral galaxies in the Virgo
cluster. In combination with archival observations, we estimate the parameters
of the KS relation for the entire ensemble of galaxies, and within individual
galaxies. We find the KS slope for the entire population to be N=0.97+/-0.07,
with a characteristic molecular gas depletion time of 1.86Gyr for our full
sample, in agreement with previous work in isolated star-forming galaxies. In
individual galaxies, we find KS slopes ranging between 0.69 and 1.40, and
typical star formation efficiencies (SFE) that can vary from galaxy to galaxy
by a factor of ~4. These galaxy-to-galaxy variations account for ~0.20dex in
scatter in the ensemble KS relation, which is characterized by a 0.42dex
scatter. We find that the HI-deficient galaxies in the Virgo cluster show a
steeper resolved KS relation and lower molecular gas efficiencies than
HI-normal cluster galaxies. While the molecular gas content in Virgo cluster
galaxies appears to behave similarly to that in isolated galaxies, our VERTICO
sample shows that cluster environments play a key role in regulating star
formation. The environmental mechanisms affecting the HI galaxy content also
have a direct impact in the SFE of molecular gas in cluster galaxies, leading
to longer depletion times in HI-deficient members.
