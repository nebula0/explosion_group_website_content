 Reconstructing how all the stellar components of the Galaxy formed and
assembled over time, by studying the properties of the stars which make it, is
the aim of Galactic archeology. In these last years, thanks to the launch of
the ESA Gaia astrometric mission, and the development of many spectroscopic
surveys, we are for the first time in the position to delve into the layers of
the past of our galaxy. Globular clusters (GCs) play a fundamental role in this
research field since they are among the oldest stellar systems in the Milky Way
(MW) and so bear witness of its entire past. In the recent years, there have
been several attempts to constrain the nature of clusters (accreted or formed
in the MW itself) through the analysis of kinematic spaces and to reconstruct
from this the properties of the accretions events experienced by the MW through
time. This work aims to test a widely-used assumption about the clustering of
the accreted populations of GCs in the integrals of motions space. We analyze a
set of dissipation-less N-body simulations that reproduce the accretion of one
or two satellites with their GC population on a MW-type galaxy. Our results
demonstrate that a significant overlap between accreted and
"kinematically-heated" in-situ GCs is expected in kinematic spaces, for mergers
with mass ratios of 1:10. In contrast with standard assumptions made in the
literature so far, we find that accreted GCs do not show dynamical coherence,
that is they do not cluster in kinematic spaces. In addition, GCs can also be
found in regions dominated by stars which have a different origin (i.e.
different progenitor). This casts doubt on the association between GCs and
field stars that is generally made in the literature to assign them to a common
origin. Our findings severely question the recovered accretion history of the
MW based on the phase-space clustering of the GC population.
