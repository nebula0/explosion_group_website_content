 The Data Release 4 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) shows an
agreement with an Harrison-Zel'dovich primordial spectrum ($n_s=1.009 \pm
0.015$), introducing a tension with a significance of $99.3\%$ CL with the
results from the Planck satellite. The discrepancy on the value of the scalar
spectral index is neither alleviated with the addition of large scale structure
information nor with the low multipole polarization data. We discuss possible
avenues to alleviate the tension relying on either neglecting polarization
measurements from ACT or in extending the inflationary sector of the theory.
