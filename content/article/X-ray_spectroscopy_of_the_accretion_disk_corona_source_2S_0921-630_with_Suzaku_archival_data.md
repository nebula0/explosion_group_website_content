 2S 0921$-$630 is an eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with an orbital
period of $\sim$ 9 days. Past X-ray observations have revealed that 2S
0921$-$630 has an extended accretion disk corona (ADC), from which most of the
X-rays from the system are emitted. We report the result of our Suzaku archival
data analysis of 2S 0921$-$630. The average X-ray spectrum is reproduced with a
blackbody emission ($kT_{\rm bb} \sim 0.3$ keV) Comptonized by optically-thick
gas (``Compton cloud''; optical depth $\tau \sim 21$) with a temperature of
$\sim 2$ keV, combined with thirteen emission lines. We find that most of the
emission lines correspond to highly ionized atoms: O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and
Fe. A K$\alpha$ emission line and an absorption edge of semi-neutral iron (Fe I
-- XVII) are also detected. The semi-neutral iron K$\alpha$ line is
significantly broad with a width of $0.11 \pm 0.02$ keV in sigma, which
corresponds to the Doppler broadening by the Kepler motion at a radius of $\sim
10^9$ cm. We suggest that the observed semi-neutral iron line originates at the
inner part of the accretion disk in the immediate outside of the Compton cloud,
i.e., the Compton cloud may have a radius of $\sim 10^9$ cm.
