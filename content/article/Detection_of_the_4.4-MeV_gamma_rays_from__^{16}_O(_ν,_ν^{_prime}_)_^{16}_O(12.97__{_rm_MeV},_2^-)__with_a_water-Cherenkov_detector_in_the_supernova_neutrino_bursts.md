 We first discuss and determine the isospin mixing of the two $2^-$ states
(12.53 MeV and 12.97 MeV) of $^{16}$O nucleus using the inelastic electron
scattering data. We then evaluate the cross section of 4.4-MeV $\gamma$ rays
produced in the neutrino neutral-current (NC) reaction $^{16}$O($\nu,
\nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O$(12.97~{\rm MeV}, 2^-$) in a water Cherenkov detector at
the low energy below 100 MeV. The detection of $\gamma$ rays for
$E_{\gamma}>5$~MeV from the NC reaction $^{16}$O($\nu,
\nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O$(E_x>16\ {\rm MeV}, T=1$) with a water Cherenkov
detector in the supernova neutrino bursts has been proposed and discussed by
several authors previously. In this article, we discuss a new NC reaction
channel from $^{16}$O(12.97 ${\rm MeV}, 2^-$) producing a 4.4-MeV $\gamma$ ray,
the cross section of which is more robust and even larger at the low energy
($E_{\nu}<25$ MeV) than the NC cross section from $^{16}$O$(E_x>16\ {\rm MeV},
T=1$). We also evaluate the number of such events induced by neutrinos from
supernova explosion which can be observed by the Super-Kamiokande, a 32 kton
water Cherenkov detector in the Earth.
