 Clouds are ubiquitous\, -- \,they arise for every solar system planet that
possesses an atmosphere and have also been suggested as a leading mechanism for
obscuring spectral features in exoplanet observations. As exoplanet
observations continue to improve, there is a need for efficient and general
planetary climate models that appropriately handle the possible cloudy
atmospheric environments that arise on these worlds. We generate a new 1D
radiative-convective terrestrial planet climate model that self-consistently
handles patchy clouds through a parameterized microphysical treatment of
condensation and sedimentation processes. Our model is general enough to
recreate Earth's atmospheric radiative environment without
over-parameterization, while also maintaining a simple implementation that is
applicable to a wide range of atmospheric compositions and physical planetary
properties. We first validate this new 1D patchy cloud radiative-convective
climate model by comparing it to Earth thermal structure data and to existing
climate and radiative transfer tools. We produce partially-clouded Earth-like
climates with cloud structures that are representative of deep tropospheric
convection and are adequate 1D representations of clouds within rocky planet
atmospheres. After validation against Earth, we then use our partially clouded
climate model and explore the potential climates of super-Earth exoplanets with
secondary nitrogen-dominated atmospheres which we assume are abiotic. We also
couple the partially clouded climate model to a full-physics, line-by-line
radiative transfer model and generate high-resolution spectra of simulated
climates. These self-consistent climate-to-spectral models bridge the gap
between climate modeling efforts and observational studies of rocky worlds.
