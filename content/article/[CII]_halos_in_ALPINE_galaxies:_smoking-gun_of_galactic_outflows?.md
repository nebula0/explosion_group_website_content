 ALMA observations have revealed that many high redshift galaxies are
surrounded by extended (10-15 kpc) $[CII]$-emitting halos which are not predicted
by even the most advanced zoom-in simulations. Using a semi-analytical model,
in a previous work we suggested that such halos are produced by
starburst-driven, catastrophically cooling outflows. Here, we further improve
the model and compare its predictions with data from 7 star-forming
($10\lesssim \rm SFR/ M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}<100$) galaxies at z=4-6, observed in
the ALPINE survey. We find that (a) detected $[CII]$ halos are a natural
by-product of starburst-driven outflows; (b) the outflow mass loading factors
are in the range $4\lesssim\eta\lesssim 7$, with higher $\eta$ values for
lower-mass, lower-SFR systems, and scale with stellar mass as $\eta \propto
M_*^{-0.43}$, consistently with the momentum-driven hypothesis. Our model
suggests that outflows are widespread phenomena in high-z galaxies. However, in
low-mass systems the halo extended $[CII]$ emission is likely too faint to be
detected with the current levels of sensitivity.
