 The mechanism to produce the numerous Galactic-Centre filaments (GCF) that
vertically penetrate the Galactic plane without clear evidence of connection to
the disc remains a mystery . Here we show that the GCFs are explained by relics
of supernova remnants (rSNR) driven by hundreds of supernovae (SNe) exploded in
the star-forming ring of the central molecular zone (CMZ) at an SN rate of
$\sim 2\times 10^{-4}$ y$^{-1}$ in the past $\sim 0.5$ My. The evolution of
rSNRs is simulated by the propagation of fast-mode magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
waves, which are shown to converge around the Galactic rotation axis by the
focusing effect. Tangential projection of the cylindrical wave fronts on the
sky constitutes the vertical filaments. The SNR model explains not only the
morphology, but also the non-thermal radio spectrum, smoothed brightness over
the distribution area consistent with the $\Sigma-D$ relation of SNR,and the
heating mechanism of hot plasma in the GC. We also discuss the implication of
this model on the study of star-formation activity in the central region of the
Galaxy.
