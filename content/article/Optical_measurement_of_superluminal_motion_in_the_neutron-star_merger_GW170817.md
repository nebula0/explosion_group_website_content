 The afterglow of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 gave evidence for a
structured relativistic jet and a link between such mergers and short gamma-ray
bursts. Superluminal motion, found using radio very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI), together with the afterglow light curve provided
constraints on the viewing angle (14-28 degrees), the opening angle of the jet
core (less than about 5 degrees), and a modest limit on the initial Lorentz
factor of the jet core (more than 4). Here we report on another superluminal
motion measurement, at seven times the speed of light, leveraging Hubble Space
Telescope precision astrometry and previous radio VLBI data of GW170817. We
thereby obtain a unique measurement of the Lorentz factor of the wing of the
structured jet, as well as substantially improved constraints on the viewing
angle (19-25 degrees) and the initial Lorentz factor of the jet core (more than
40).
