 New optical photometric, spectrocopic and imaging polarimetry data are
combined with publicly available data to study some of the physical properties
of the two H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN) SN 2021bnw and SN 2021fpl.
For each SLSN, the best-fit parameters obtained from the magnetar model with
\texttt{MOSFiT} do not depart from the range of parameter obtained on other
SLSNe discussed in the literature. A spectral analysis with \texttt{SYN++}
shows that SN 2021bnw is a W Type, Fast evolver, while SN 2021fpl is a 15bn
Type, Slow evolver. The analysis of the polarimetry data obtained on SN 2021fpl
at four epochs (+1.8, +20.6, +34.1 and +43.0 days, rest-frame) shows $>
3\sigma$ polarization detections in the range 0.8--1 $\%$. A comparison of the
spectroscopy data suggests that SN 2021fpl underwent a spectral transition a
bit earlier than SN 2015bn, during which, similarly, it could have underwent a
polarization transition. The analysis of the polarimetry data obtained on SN
2021bnw do not show any departure from symmetry of the photosphere at an
empirical diffusion timescale of $\approx$ 2 (+81.1 days rest-frame). This
result is consistent with those on the sample of W Type SLSN observed at
empirical diffusion timescale $\le$ 1 with that technique, even though it is
not clear the effect of limited spectral windows varying from one object to the
other. Measurements at higher empirical diffusion timescale may be needed to
see any departure from symmetry as it is discussed in the literature for SN
2017egm.
