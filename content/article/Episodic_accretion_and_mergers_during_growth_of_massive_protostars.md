 3D simulations of high mass young stellar object (HMYSO) growth show that
their circumstellar discs fragment onto multiple self-gravitating objects.
Accretion of these by HMYSO may explain episodic accretion bursts discovered
recently. We post-process results of a previous 3D simulation of a HMYSO disc
with a 1D code that resolves the disc and object dynamics down to the stellar
surface. We find that burst-like deposition of material into the inner disc
seen in 3D simulations by itself does not always signify powerful accretion
bursts. Only high density post-collapse clumps crossing the inner computational
boundary may result in observable bursts. The rich physics of the inner disc
has a significant impact on the expected accretion bursts: (1) In the standard
turbulent viscosity discs, migrating objects can stall at a migration trap at
the distance of a few au from the star. However, in discs powered by magnetised
winds, the objects are able to cross the trap and produce bursts akin to those
observed so far. (2) Migrating objects may interact with and modify the thermal
(hydrogen ionisation) instability of the inner disc, which can be responsible
for longer duration and lower luminosity bursts in HMYSOs. (3) If the central
star is bloated to a fraction of an au by a previous episode of high accretion
rate, or if the migrating object is particularly dense, a merger rather than a
disc-mediated accretion burst results; (4) Object disruption bursts may be
super-Eddington, leading to episodic feedback on HMYSO surroundings via
powerful outflows.
