 We report the discovery of a compact group of galaxies, CGG-z5, at z~5.2 in
the EGS field covered by the JWST/CEERS survey. CGG-z5 was selected as the
highest overdensity of galaxies at z>2 in recent JWST public surveys and
consists of six candidate members lying within a projected area of 1.5''x3''
(10x20 kpc$^2$). All group members are HST/F435W and HST/F606W dropouts while
securely detected in the JWST/NIRCam bands, yielding a narrow range of robust
photometric redshifts 5.0<z<5.3. The most massive galaxy in the group has
stellar mass log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\approx9.8$ while the rest are low mass
satellites (log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\approx8.4-9.2$). While several group members
were already detected in HST and IRAC bands, the low stellar masses and the
compactness of the structure required the sensitivity and resolution of JWST
for its identification. To assess the nature and evolutionary path of CGG-z5 we
searched for similar compact structures in the EAGLE simulation and followed
their evolution with time. We find that all the identified structures merge
into a single galaxy by z=3 and form a massive galaxy
(log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot})>11$) at z~1. This implies that CGG-z5 could be a
``proto-massive galaxy" captured during a short-lived phase of massive galaxy
formation.
