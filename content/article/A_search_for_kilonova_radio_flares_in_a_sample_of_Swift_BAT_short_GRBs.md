 The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed that binary neutron star
(BNS) mergers are progenitors of (at least some) short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),
and that short GRB jets (and their afterglows) can have structures (and
observational properties) more complex than predicted by the standard top-hat
jet scenario. Indeed, the emission from the structured jet launched in GW170817
peaked in the radio band (cm wavelengths) at about 100 d since merger - a
timescale much longer than the typical time span of radio follow-up
observations of short GRBs. Moreover, radio searches for a potential late-time
radio flare from the fast tail of the neutron-rich debris that powered the
kilonova associated with GW170817 (AT2017gfo) have extended to even longer
timescales (years after the merger). In light of this, here we present the
results of an observational campaign targeting a sample of seven, years-old
GRBs in the Swift/BAT sample with no redshift measurements and no
promptly-identified X-ray counterpart. Our goal is to assess whether this
sample of short GRBs could harbor nearby BNS mergers, searching for the
late-time radio emission expected from their ejecta. We found one radio
candidate counterpart for one of the GRBs in our sample, GRB111126A, though an
origin related to emission from star formation or from an AGN in its host
galaxy cannot be excluded without further observations.
