 We analyse the connection between the star formation quenching of galaxies
and their location in theoutskirts of clusters in the redshift range $z=[0,2]$
by estimating the fraction of red galaxies. More specifically, we focus on
galaxies that infall isotropically from those that are infalling alongside
filaments. We use a sample of galaxies obtained from the semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation SAG applied to the MultiDark simulation. {\textsc{mdpl2}}. In
agreement with observational results, we find that the infall regions show
levels of star formation that are intermediate between those of galaxies in
clusters and in the field.
  Moreover, we show that, in the redshift range [0-0.85], the quenching of the
star formation is stronger in the filamentary region than in the isotropic
infall region. We also study the fraction of red galaxies as a function of the
normalised distance to the cluster centre and find that, for radii $R/R_{200}>
3 $, the fraction of red galaxies in the filamentary region is considerably
larger than in the isotropic infall region. From the analysis of properties of
the main progenitors of galaxies identified at $z = 0$, we find that they have
different evolutionary behaviours depending on the stellar mass and
environment. Our results confirm the observational findings that suggest that
the infall regions of clusters play an important role in the pre-processing of
galaxies along most of the evolutionary history of galaxies.
