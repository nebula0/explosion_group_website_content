 Understanding stellar composition is fundamental not only to our
comprehension of the galaxy, especially chemical evolution, but it can also
shed light on the interior structure and mineralogy of exoplanets, which are
formed from the same material as their host stars. Unfortunately, the
underlying mathematics describing stellar mass fractions and stellar elemental
abundances is difficult to parse, fragmented across the literature, and
contains vexing omissions that makes any calculation far from trivial,
especially for non-experts. In this treatise, we present clear mathematical
formalism and clarification of inherent assumptions and normalizations within
stellar composition measurements, which facilitates the conversion from stellar
mass fractions to elemental abundances to molar ratios, including error
propagation. We also provide an example case study of HIP 544 to further
illustrate the provided equations. Given the important chemical association
between stars, as well as the interdisciplinary relationship between stars and
their planets, it is vital that stellar mass fractions and abundance data be
more transparent and accessible to people within different sub-fields and
scientific disciplines.
