 The assembly of supermassive black holes poses a challenge primarily because
of observed quasars at high redshift, but additionally because of the current
lack of observations of intermediate mass black holes. One plausible scenario
for creating supermassive black holes is direct collapse triggered by the
merger of two gas rich galaxies. This scenario allows the creation of
supermassive stars with up to solar metallicity, where the enhanced metallicity
is enabled by extremely rapid accretion. We investigate the behavior of metal
enriched supermassive protostars which collapse due to the general relativistic
radial instability. These stars are rich in both hydrogen and metals and thus
may explode due to the CNO cycle (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) and the rp process
(rapid proton capture). We perform a suite of 1D general relativistic
hydrodynamical simulations coupled to a 153 isotope nuclear network with the
effects of neutrino cooling. We determine the mass and metallicity ranges for
an explosion. We then post process using a 514 isotope network which captures
the full rp process. We present nucleosynthesis and lightcurves for selected
models. These events are characterized by enhanced nitrogen, suppressed light
elements ($8\geq\rm{A}\geq14$), and low mass p nuclides and they are visible to
JWST and other near infrared surveys as decades-long transients. Finally, we
provide an estimate for the number of currently ongoing explosions in the
Universe.
