 Magnetic fields grow quickly, even at early cosmological times, suggesting
the action of a small-scale dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM) of
galaxies. Many studies have focused on idealized, isotropic, homogeneous,
turbulent driving of the SSD. Here we analyze more realistic simulations of
supernova-driven turbulence to understand how it drives an SSD. We find that
SSD growth rates are intermittently variable as a result of the evolving
multiphase ISM structure. Rapid growth in the magnetic field typically occurs
in hot gas, with the highest overall growth rates occurring when the fractional
volume of hot gas is large. SSD growth rates correlate most strongly with
vorticity, which also correlates well with gas temperature. Rotational energy
exceeds irrotational energy in all phases, but particularly in the hot phase
while SSD growth is most rapid. Supernova (SN) rate does not significantly
affect the ISM average kinetic energy density. Rather, higher temperatures
associated with high SN rates tend to increase SSD growth rates. SSD saturates
with total magnetic energy density around 5% of equipartition to kinetic energy
density, increasing slightly with magnetic Prandtl number. While magnetic
energy density in the hot gas can exceed that of the other phases when SSD
grows most rapidly, it saturates below 5% of equipartition with kinetic energy
in the hot gas, while in the cold gas it attains 100%. Fast, intermittent
growth of the magnetic field appears to be a characteristic behavior of
SN-driven, multiphase turbulence.
