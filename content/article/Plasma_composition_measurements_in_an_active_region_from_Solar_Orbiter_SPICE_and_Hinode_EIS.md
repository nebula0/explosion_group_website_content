 A key goal of the Solar Orbiter mission is to connect elemental abundance
measurements of the solar wind enveloping the spacecraft with EUV spectroscopic
observations of their solar sources, but this is not an easy exercise.
Observations from previous missions have revealed a highly complex picture of
spatial and temporal variations of elemental abundances in the solar corona. We
have used coordinated observations from Hinode and Solar Orbiter to attempt new
abundance measurements with the SPICE (Spectral Imaging of the Coronal
Environment) instrument, and benchmark them against standard analyses from EIS
(EUV Imaging Spectrometer). We use observations of several solar features in AR
12781 taken from an Earth-facing view by EIS on 2020 November 10, and SPICE
data obtained one week later on 2020 November 17; when the AR had rotated into
the Solar Orbiter field-of-view. We identify a range of spectral lines that are
useful for determining the transition region and low coronal temperature
structure with SPICE, and demonstrate that SPICE measurements are able to
differentiate between photospheric and coronal Mg/Ne abundances. The
combination of SPICE and EIS is able to establish the atmospheric composition
structure of a fan loop/outflow area at the active region edge. We also discuss
the problem of resolving the degree of elemental fractionation with SPICE,
which is more challenging without further constraints on the temperature
structure, and comment on what that can tell us about the sources of the solar
wind and solar energetic particles.
