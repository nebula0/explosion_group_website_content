 Using radiation-hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, we present a detailed
($0.1$ pc resolution), physically motivated portrait of a typical-mass dwarf
galaxy before the epoch of reionization, resolving the formation and evolution
of star clusters into individual $10\:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ star particles. In
the rest-frame UV, the galaxy has an irregular morphology with no bulge or
galactic disk, dominated by light emitted from numerous, compact, and
gravitationally-bound star clusters. This is especially interesting in light of
recent HST and JWST observations that -- aided by the magnifying power of
gravitational lenses -- have imaged, at parsec-scale resolution, individual
young star clusters in the process of forming in similar galaxies at $z>6$.
Because of their low metallicities and high temperatures, star-forming gas
clouds in this galaxy have densities $\sim 100$ times higher than typical giant
molecular clouds; hence, their star formation efficiencies are high enough
($f_*\sim10-70$ per cent) to produce a sizeable population of potential
globular cluster progenitors but typically smaller (between a few $100\:-\:
2\times10^4\:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, sizes of $0.1-3$ pc) and of lower
metallicities ($10^{-3.5}-10^{-2.5}\:\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$). The initial mass
function of the star-forming clouds is log-normal while the bound star cluster
mass function is a power-law with a slope that depends mainly on $f_*$ but also
on the temporal proximity to a major starburst. We find slopes between $-0.5$
and $-2.5$ depending on the assumed sub-grid $f_*$. Star formation is
self-regulated on galactic scales; however, the multi-modal metallicity
distribution of the star clusters and the fraction of stars locked into
surviving bound star clusters depends on $f_*$.
