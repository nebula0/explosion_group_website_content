 Parity violation is expected to generate an asymmetry between the amplitude
of left and right-handed gravitational-wave modes which leads to a circularly
polarized stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). Due to the three
independent baselines in the LIGO-Virgo network, we focus on the amplitude
difference in strain power characterized by Stokes' parameters and do
maximum-likelihood estimation to constrain the polarization degree of SGWB. Our
results indicate that there is no evidence for the circularly polarized SGWB in
the data. Furthermore, by modeling the SGWB as a power-law spectrum, we place
upper limit on the normalized energy density
$\Omega_\text{gw}(25\,\text{Hz})<5.3\times10^{-9}$ at $95\%$ confidence level
after marginalizing over the polarization degree and spectral index.
