 Type Ia supernovae are thought to be carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that
explode after accreting material from a companion star, but despite extensive
studies the nature of the companion star is still poorly understood, as is the
explosion mechanism. In the single degenerate scenario, the companion is a
non-degenerate star that loses material through winds and/or binary
interaction, and a few Type Ia supernovae have shown evidence for hydrogen-rich
circumstellar material. We present here the study of SN 2020eyj, a unique Type
Ia supernova showing delayed interaction with helium-rich, but hydrogen-poor,
circumstellar material. This material surrounding SN 2020eyj is revealed by its
unusual light curve and infrared emission, narrow helium emission lines and,
for the first time ever in a Type Ia supernova, also a radio counterpart. The
circumstellar material likely originates from the companion star, providing the
first direct evidence for a, so far hypothesized, single degenerate progenitor
system composed of a white dwarf and a helium donor star.
