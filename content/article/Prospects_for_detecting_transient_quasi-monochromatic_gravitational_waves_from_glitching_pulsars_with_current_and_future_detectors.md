 Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that emit periodic electromagnetic
radiation. While pulsars generally slow down as they lose energy, some also
experience glitches: spontaneous increases of their rotational frequency.
According to several models, these glitches can also lead to the emission of
long-duration transient gravitational waves (GWs). We present detection
prospects for such signals by comparing indirect energy upper limits on GW
strain for known glitches with the sensitivity of current and future
ground-based GW detectors. We first consider generic constraints based on the
glitch size and find that realistic matched-filter searches in the fourth
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4) could make a detection, or set constraints
below these indirect upper limits, for equivalents of 36 out of 726 previously
observed glitches, and 74 in the O5 run. With the third-generation Einstein
Telescope or Cosmic Explorer, 35-40% of glitches would be accessible. When
specialising to a scenario where transient mountains produce the post-glitch GW
emission, following Yim & Jones (2020), the indirect upper limits are stricter.
Out of the smaller set of 119 glitches with measured healing parameter, as
needed for predictions under that model, only 6 glitches would have been within
reach for O4 and 14 for O5, with a similar percentage as before with third
generation detectors. We also discuss how this model matches the observed
glitch population.
