 We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) K-band (19 GHz) observations
of the redshifted CO(1-0) line emission toward the radio galaxy TN J0924$-$2201
at $z=5.2$, which is one of the most distant CO-detected radio galaxies. With
the angular resolution of $\sim2''$, the CO(1-0) line emission is resolved into
three clumps, within $\pm500$ km\,s$^{-1}$ relative to its redshift, where is
determined by Ly$\alpha$. We find that they locate off-center and 12-33 kpc
away from the center of the host galaxy, which has counterparts in $HST$
$i$-band, $Spitzer$/IRAC and ALMA Band-6 (230 GHz; 1.3 mm). With the ALMA
detection, we estimate $L_{\rm IR}$ and SFR of the host galaxy to be
$(9.3\pm1.7)\times10^{11} L_{\odot}$ and $110\pm20$ $M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$,
respectively. We also derive the $3\sigma$ upper limit of $M_{\rm
H_{2}}<1.3\times10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ at the host galaxy. The detected CO(1-0)
line luminosities of three clumps, $L'_{\rm CO(1-0)}$ =
(3.2-4.7)$\times10^{10}$ $\rm\,K\,km\,s^{-1}pc^{2}$, indicate the presence of
three massive molecular gas reservoirs with $M_{\rm H_{2}}$ =
(2.5-3.7)$\times10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$, by assuming the CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion
factor $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.8$ $M_{\rm \odot}\rm\,(K\,km\,s^{-1}pc^{2})^{-1}$,
although the star formation rate (SFR) is not elevated because of the
non-detection of ALMA 1.3 mm continuum (SFR $<$ 40 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). From
the host galaxy, the nearest molecular gas clump labeled as clump A, is
apparently aligning with the radio jet axis, showing the radio-CO alignment.
The possible origin of these three clumps around TN J0924$-$2201 can be
interpreted as merger, jet-induced metal enrichment and outflow.
