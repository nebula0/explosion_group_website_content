        Many cosmological phenomena lead to the production of primordial black holes in the early Universe. These phenomena often create a population of black holes with extended mass and spin distributions. As these black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, they can modify various cosmological observables, lead to the production of dark matter, modify the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, $N_{\rm eff}$, source a stochastic gravitational wave background and alter the dynamics of baryogenesis. We consider the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes that feature non-trivial mass and spin distributions in the early Universe. We demonstrate that the shape of such a distribution can strongly affect most of the aforementioned cosmological observables. We outline the numerical machinery we use to undertake this task. We also release a new version of FRISBHEE that handles the evaporation of primordial black holes with an arbitrary mass and spin distribution throughout cosmic history.
