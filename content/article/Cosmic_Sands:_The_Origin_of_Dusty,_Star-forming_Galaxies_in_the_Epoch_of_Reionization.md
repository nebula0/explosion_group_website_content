 We present the Cosmic Sands suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations based
on the Simba galaxy formation model in order to study the build up of the first
massive and dusty galaxies in the early Universe. Residing in the most massive
halos, we find that the compact proto-massive galaxies undergo nearly
continuous mergers with smaller subhalos, boosting star formation rates (SFRs)
and the build up of stellar mass. The galaxies are already appreciably
chemically evolved by z=10, with modeled dust masses comparable to those
inferred from observations in the same epoch. We track gas accretion onto the
galaxies to understand how extreme SFRs can be sustained by these early
systems. We find that smooth gas accretion can maintain SFRs above 250
M$_{\odot}$ / yr but to achieve SFRs that boost galaxies well above the main
sequence, a larger perturbation like a gas-rich major merger is necessary to
trigger a starburst episode. Post-processing the Cosmic Sands simulations with
dust radiative transfer, we find that while the infrared luminosities of the
most dust rich galaxies are comparable to local ULIRGs, they are substantially
dimmer than classical z=2 sub-millimeter galaxies. We end with a discussion on
the possible reasons for this discrepancy at the highest masses and the future
work we intend to carry out to study the chemical enrichment of the earliest
dusty galaxies.
