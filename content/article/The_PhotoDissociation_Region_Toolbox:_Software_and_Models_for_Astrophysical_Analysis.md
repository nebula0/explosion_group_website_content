 The PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox provides comprehensive, easy-to-use,
public software tools and models that enable an understanding of the
interaction of the light of young, luminous, massive stars with the gas and
dust in the Milky Way and in other galaxies. It consists of an open-source
Python toolkit and photodissociation region models for analysis of infrared and
millimeter/submillimeter line and continuum observations obtained by
ground-based and sub-orbital telescopes, and astrophysics space missions.
Photodissociation regions (PDRs) include all of the neutral gas in the ISM
where far-ultraviolet photons dominate the chemistry and/or heating. In regions
of massive star formation, PDRs are created at the boundaries between the H II
regions and neutral molecular cloud, as photons with energies 6 eV $ < h \nu <
$ 13.6 eV photodissociate molecules and photoionize metals. The gas is heated
by photo-electrons from small grains and large molecules and cools mostly
through far-infrared fine-structure lines like [O I] and [C II]. The models are
created from state-of-the art PDR codes that includes molecular freeze-out;
recent collision, chemical, and photo rates; new chemical pathways, such as for
oxygen chemistry; and allow for both clumpy and uniform media. The models
predict the emergent intensities of many spectral lines and FIR continuum. The
tools find the best-fit models to the observations and provide insights into
the physical conditions and chemical makeup of the gas and dust. The PDR
Toolbox enables novel analysis of data from telescopes such as ISO, Spitzer,
Herschel, STO, SOFIA, SWAS, APEX, ALMA, and JWST.
