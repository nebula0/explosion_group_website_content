 We review the recent observations of protoplanetary disks together with
relevant theoretical studies with an emphasis on the evolution of volatiles. In
the last several years Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
provided evidence of grain growth, gas-dust decoupling, and sub-structures such
as rings and gaps in the dust continuum. Molecular line observations revealed
radial and vertical distributions of molecular abundances and also provided
significant constraints on the gas dynamics such as turbulence. While
sub-millimeter and millimeter observations mainly probe the gas and dust
outside the radius of several au, ice and inner warm gas are investigated at
shorter wavelengths. Gas and dust dynamics are key to connecting these
observational findings. One of the emerging trends is inhomogeneous
distributions of elemental abundances, most probably due to dust-gas
decoupling.
