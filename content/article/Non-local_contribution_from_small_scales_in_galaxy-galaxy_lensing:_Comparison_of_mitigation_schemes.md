 Recent cosmological analyses with large-scale structure and weak lensing
measurements, usually referred to as 3$\times$2pt, had to discard a lot of
signal-to-noise from small scales due to our inability to precisely model
non-linearities and baryonic effects. Galaxy-galaxy lensing, or the
position-shear correlation between lens and source galaxies, is one of the
three two-point correlation functions that are included in such analyses,
usually estimated with the mean tangential shear. However, tangential shear
measurements at a given angular scale $\theta$ or physical scale $R$ carry
information from all scales below that, forcing the scale cuts applied in real
data to be significantly larger than the scale at which theoretical
uncertainties become problematic. Recently there have been a few independent
efforts that aim to mitigate the non-locality of the galaxy-galaxy lensing
signal. Here we perform a comparison of the different methods, including the Y
transformation described in Park et al. (2021), the point-mass marginalization
methodology presented in MacCrann et al. (2020) and the Annular Differential
Surface Density statistic described in Baldauf et al. (2010). We do the
comparison at the cosmological constraints level in a noiseless simulated
combined galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis. We find that all
the estimators perform equivalently using a Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) Year 1 like setup. This is because all the estimators
project out the mode responsible for the non-local nature of the galaxy-galaxy
lensing measurements, which we have identified as $1/R^2$. We finally apply all
the estimators to DES Y3 data and confirm that they all give consistent
results.
