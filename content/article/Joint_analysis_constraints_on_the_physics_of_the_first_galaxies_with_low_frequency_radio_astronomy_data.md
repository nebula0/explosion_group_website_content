 Observations of the first billion years of cosmic history are currently
limited. We demonstrate the synergy between observations of the sky-averaged
21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen and interferometric measurements of the
corresponding spatial fluctuations. By jointly analysing data from SARAS3
(redshift $z\approx15-25$) and limits from HERA ($z\approx8$ and $10$), we
produce the tightest constraints to date on the astrophysics of galaxies 200
million years after the Big Bang. We disfavour at $95\%$ confidence scenarios
in which power spectra are $\geq126$ mK$^{2}$ at $z=25$ and the sky-averaged
signals are $\leq-277$ mK.
