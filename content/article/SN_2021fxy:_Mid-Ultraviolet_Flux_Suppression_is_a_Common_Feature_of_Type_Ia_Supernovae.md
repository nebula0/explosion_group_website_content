 We present ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) observations and analysis
of the nearby Type Ia supernova SN 2021fxy. Our observations include UV
photometry from Swift/UVOT, UV spectroscopy from HST/STIS, and high-cadence
optical photometry with the Swope 1-m telescope capturing intra-night rises
during the early light curve. Early $B-V$ colours show SN 2021fxy is the first
"shallow-silicon" (SS) SN Ia to follow a red-to-blue evolution, compared to
other SS objects which show blue colours from the earliest observations.
Comparisons to other spectroscopically normal SNe Ia with HST UV spectra reveal
SN 2021fxy is one of several SNe Ia with flux suppression in the mid-UV. These
SNe also show blue-shifted mid-UV spectral features and strong high-velocity Ca
II features. One possible origin of this mid-UV suppression is the increased
effective opacity in the UV due to increased line blanketing from high velocity
material, but differences in the explosion mechanism cannot be ruled out. Among
SNe Ia with mid-UV suppression, SNe 2021fxy and 2017erp show substantial
similarities in their optical properties despite belonging to different Branch
subgroups, and UV flux differences of the same order as those found between SNe
2011fe and 2011by. Differential comparisons to multiple sets of synthetic SN Ia
UV spectra reveal this UV flux difference likely originates from a luminosity
difference between SNe 2021fxy and 2017erp, and not differing progenitor
metallicities as suggested for SNe 2011by and 2011fe. These comparisons
illustrate the complicated nature of UV spectral formation, and the need for
more UV spectra to determine the physical source of SNe Ia UV diversity.
