 Cool outflows are now commonly observed in galaxies, but their physical
origin and driving mechanism remain unclear. Active galactic nucleus (AGN)
feedback can potentially accelerate cool galactic outflows via cosmic rays (CR)
and radiation pressure on dust. Here we investigate the relative importance of
CR and radiation feedback in AGNs, and we analyse the physical conditions for
outflow launching as a function of the black hole accretion flow mode. We
assume CRs from AGN jet origin and consider the analogy with Galactic X-ray
binaries, whereby the jet is prominent at low accretion rates (hard state) and
quenched at high accretion rates (soft state). We show that CR-driven outflows
can be powered at low accretion rates and at large radii, whereas radiation
pressure-driven outflows dominate at high accretion rates and small radii. Thus
the two AGN feedback mechanisms -- CRs and radiation pressure on dust -- may
play complementary roles in driving cool outflows on galactic scales. The
transition from radiation pressure-driven outflows at higher accretion rates to
CR-driven outflows at lower accretion rates likely corresponds to a transition
in the underlying accretion flow modes (from a radiatively efficient accretion
disc to a radiatively inefficient jet-dominated flow) over cosmic time.
