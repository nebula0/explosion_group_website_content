 Transmission spectroscopy is a prime technique to study the chemical
composition and structure of exoplanetary atmospheres. Strong excess absorption
signals have been detected in the optical Na I D1, 2 Fraunhofer lines during
transits of hot Jupiters, which are attributed to the planetary atmospheres and
allow us to constrain its structure. We study the atmosphere of WASP-7 b by
means of high-resolution transit spectroscopy in the sodium lines. We analyze a
spectral transit time-series of 89 high-resolution spectra of the hot Jupiter
WASP-7 b that was observed using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle
Spectrograph (UVES). We use the telluric lines for an accurate alignment of the
spectra and carry out a telluric correction with molecfit. Stellar magnetic
activity is monitored by investigating chromospheric lines such as the Ca II H
and K and hydrogen H$\alpha$ lines. Finally, we obtain transmission spectra and
light curves for various lines. The star shows no identifiable flares and, if
any, marginal changes in activity during our observing run. The sodium
transmission spectra and corresponding light curves clearly show signs of the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (RM) and the stellar center-to-limb variation (CLV)
that we model using synthetic spectra. A statistically significant, narrow
absorption feature with a line contrast of 0.50$\pm$0.06% (at $\sim 8.3\sigma$
level) and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.13$\pm$0.02 A is detected
at the location of the Na I D$_2$ line. For the Na I D$_1$ line signal, we
derive a line contrast of 0.13$\pm$0.04% (at $\sim 3.2\sigma$ level), which we
consider a tentative detection. In addition, we provide upper limits for
absorption by the hydrogen Balmer lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$), K
I $\lambda$7699 A, Ca II H and K, and infra-red triplet (IRT) lines.
