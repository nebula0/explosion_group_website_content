 We use the ROGER code by de los Rios et al. to classify galaxies around a
sample of X-ray clusters into five classes according to their positions in the
projected phase space diagram: cluster galaxies, backsplash galaxies, recent
infallers, infalling galaxies, and interlopers. To understand the effects of
the cluster environment to the evolution of galaxies, we compare across the
five classes: stellar mass, specific star formation rate, size, and morphology.
Following the guidelines of Coenda et al., a separate analysis is carried out
for red and blue galaxies. For red galaxies, cluster galaxies differ from the
other classes, having a suppressed specific star formation rate, smaller sizes,
and are more likely to be classified as ellipticals. Differences are smaller
between the other classes, however backsplash galaxies have significantly lower
specific star formation rates than early or recent infalling galaxies. For blue
galaxies, we find evidence that recent infallers are smaller than infalling
galaxies and interlopers, while the latter two are comparable in size. Our
results provide evidence that, after a single passage, the cluster environment
can diminish a galaxy's star formation, modify its morphology, and can also
reduce in size blue galaxies. We find evidence that quenching occurs faster
than morphological transformation from spirals to ellipticals for all classes.
While quenching is evidently enhanced as soon as galaxies get into clusters,
significant morphological transformations require galaxies to experience the
action of the physical mechanisms of the cluster for longer timescales.
