 We develop a pipeline to set new constraints on scale-independent modified
gravity, from the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space of BOSS DR12. The
latter is modelled using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up
to 1-loop order in perturbation theory. We test our pipeline on synthetic and
simulated data, to assess systematic biases on the inferred cosmological
parameters due to marginalization and theoretical errors, and we apply it to
the normal branch of the DGP model with a $\Lambda$CDM background. We observe
biased posteriors due to the strong degeneracy between the nDGP parameter
$\Omega_{\rm rc}$ and the primordial amplitude of fluctuations $A_s$. Fixing
the latter to the Planck central value, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm rc}\lesssim 0.2$
at 95$\%$ C.L. We also discuss a procedure to alleviate the prior dependence of
this bound.
