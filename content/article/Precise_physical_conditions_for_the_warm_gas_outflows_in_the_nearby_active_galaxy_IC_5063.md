 AGN-driven outflows are now routinely used in models of galaxy evolution as a
feedback mechanism, however many of their properties remain highly uncertain.
Perhaps the greatest source of uncertainty is the electron density of the
outflowing gas, which directly affects derived kinetic powers and mass outflow
rates. Here we present spatially-resolved, wide spectral-coverage Xshooter
observations of the nearby active galaxy IC 5063 (z=0.001131), which shows
clear signatures of outflows being driven by shocks induced by a radio jet
interacting with the ISM. For the first time, we use the higher
critical-density transauroral [SII] and [OII] lines to derive electron
densities in spatially-resolved observations of an active galaxy, and present
evidence that the lines are emitted in the same spatial regions as other key
diagnostic lines. In addition, we find that the post-shock gas is denser than
the pre-shock gas, possibly due to shock compression effects. We derive kinetic
powers for the warm ionised outflow phase and find them to be below those
required by galaxy evolution models; however, other studies of different gas
phases in IC 5063 allow us to place our results in a wider context in which the
cooler gas phases constitute most of the outflowing mass. We investigate the
dominant ionisation and excitation mechanisms and find that the warm ionised
outflow phase is dominated by AGN-photoionisation, while the warm molecular
phase has composite AGN-shock excitation. Overall, our results highlight the
importance of robust outflow diagnostics and reinforce the utility of the
transauroral lines for future studies of outflows in active galaxies.
