 Voids occupy about 3/4 of the volume of the Universe and contain about 15% of
its mass. Due to various observational selection effects, these structure
elements and galaxies populating voids, are highly under-explored. This
especially relates to the lowest mass galaxies which comprise the main void
population. Studying the nearby voids allows us to improve our understanding of
the most elusive void objects. We present the brief overview of the current
status and the prospects of the study of the nearest voids and their galaxies.
First, we summarize the pioneer study of a hundred galaxies residing in the
nearby Lynx-Cancer void which clearly evidence for the slower evolution of void
galaxies and finds also the unusual very metal-poor and gas-rich dwarfs. Then
we describe the recently defined sample of the nearby voids within the sphere
with R = 25 Mpc and a sample of 1350 galaxies residing in these voids (~20% of
all galaxies within this volume). We discuss the current results obtained for
several directions of the study of this sample. They include: the search for
Very Young Galaxies, the study of HI properties, the clustering of void
galaxies and its relation to the void substructures, and the unbiased study of
260 void galaxies within the Local Volume (R < 11 Mpc). Altogether, this opens
a perspective way to address the suggested peculiarities of the void galaxy
formation and evolution. Finally, we briefly overview the expected advancements
in the void galaxy studies related to the upcoming new facilities.
