 Previous studies found that stellar scattering by massive clumps can lead to
the formation of exponential profiles in galaxy discs, but details on how a
star is moved around have not been fully explained. We use a GADGET-2
simulation where an exponential profile forms from an initially Gaussian disc
in about 4 Gyr for a low-mass galaxy like a dwarf irregular. We find that
nearly all large angular momentum changes of stars are caused by star-clump
encounters with the closest approach less than 0.5 kpc. During star-clump
encounters, stars may increase their random motions, resulting in an increase
in the average radial and vertical actions of the whole stellar population. The
angular momentum change and the radial action change of an individual star are
influenced by the direction from which the star approaches a clump. A star
initially at a higher galactic radius relative to the scattering clump usually
gets pulled inwards and loses its angular momentum during the encounter, and
one at a lower radius tends to shift outwards and gains angular momentum. The
increase in the radial action is the largest if a star encounters a clump from
the azimuthal direction, and is the smallest from a radial approach. The
angular momentum change due to encounters has an inward bias when the clump
profile has a steep radial decline, and a shallow decline can make the bias
outwards. The stellar profile evolution towards an exponential seems to occur
regardless of the direction of the bias.
