 We present deep Chandra observations of the pre-merger galaxy cluster Abell
98. Abell 98 is a complex merging system. While the northern (A98N) and central
subclusters (A98S) are merging along the north-south direction, A98S is
undergoing a separate late-stage merger, with two distinct X-ray cores. We
report detection of gas sloshing spirals in A98N and in the eastern core of
A98S. We detect two cold front edges in A98N. We find two more surface
brightness edges along the east direction of the eastern core and west
direction of the western core of A98S. We measure the temperatures and gas
densities across those edges, and find that the eastern edge appears to be a
cold front while the western edge is a shock front with a Mach number of
$\cal{M}$ $\approx$ 1.5. We detect a "tail" of X-ray emission associated with
the eastern core of A98S. Our measurement indicates that the tail is cooler
than the surrounding gas at a 4.2-$\sigma$ level, suggesting the tail is part
of a cool core remnant that has been ram-pressure stripped.
