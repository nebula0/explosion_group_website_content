 Environment has long been known to have significant impact on the evolution
of galaxies, but here we seek to quantify the subtler differences that might be
found in disk galaxies, depending on whether they are isolated, the most
massive galaxy in a group (centrals), or a lesser member (satellites). The
MaNGA survey allows us to define a large mass-matched sample of 574 galaxies
with high-quality integrated spectra in each category. Initial examination of
their spectral indices indicates significant differences, particularly in
low-mass galaxies. Semi-analytic spectral fitting of a full chemical evolution
model to these spectra confirms these differences, with low-mass satellites
having a shorter period of star formation and chemical enrichment typical of a
closed box, while central galaxies have more extended histories, with evidence
of on-going gas accretion over their lifetimes. The derived parameters for gas
infall timescale and wind strength suggest that low-mass satellite galaxies
have their hot halos of gas effectively removed, while central galaxies retain
a larger fraction of gas than isolated galaxies due to the deeper group
potential well in which they sit. S0 galaxies form a distinct subset within the
sample, particularly at higher masses, but do not bias the inferred lower-mass
environmental impact significantly. The consistent picture that emerges
underlines the wealth of archaeological information that can be extracted from
high-quality spectral data using techniques like semi-analytic spectral
fitting.
