 Double white dwarfs (DWDs) will be the most numerous gravitational-wave (GW)
sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Most of the Galactic
DWDs will be unresolved and will superpose to form a confusion noise
foreground, the dominant LISA noise source around $\sim
0.5\mathrm{-}3\,\mathrm{mHz}$. A small fraction of these sources will stand out
from the background and be individually detectable. Uniquely among GW sources,
a handful of these binaries will be known in advance from electromagnetic
observations and will be guaranteed sources of detectable GWs in the LISA band;
these are known as verification binaries (VBs). High-cadence photometric
surveys are continuously discovering new VB systems, and their number will
continue to grow ahead of the launch of LISA. We analyse, in a fully Bayesian
framework, all the currently known VBs with the latest design requirements for
the LISA mission. We explore what can be expected from GW observations, both
alone and in combination with electromagnetic observations, and estimate the
VB's time to detection in the early months of LISA operations. We also show how
VBs can be analysed in the (realistic) case where their GW signals compete with
many other unknown binary signals (both resolved and unresolved) from the
Galactic population of DWDs.
