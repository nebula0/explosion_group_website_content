 Alternative cosmological models have been under deep scrutiny in recent
years, aiming to address the main shortcomings of the $\Lambda$CDM model.
Moreover, as the accuracy of cosmological surveys improved, new tensions have
risen between the model-dependent analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background
and lower redshift probes. Within this framework, we review two
quantum-inspired non-locally extended theories of gravity, whose main
cosmological feature is a geometrically driven accelerated expansion. The
models are especially investigated in light of the Hubble and growth tension,
and promising features emerge for the Deser--Woodard one. On the one hand, the
cosmological analysis of the phenomenological formulation of the model shows a
lowered growth of structures but an equivalent background with respect to
$\Lambda$CDM. On the other hand, the study of the lensing features at the
galaxy cluster scale of a new formulation of non-local cosmology, based on
Noether symmetries, makes room for the possibility of alleviating both the
$H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tension. However, the urgent need for a screening
mechanism arises for this non-local theory of gravity.
