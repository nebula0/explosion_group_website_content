 Throughout the passage within the Galactic halo, high-velocity clouds (HVCs)
sweep up ambient magnetic fields and form stretched and draped configurations
of magnetic fields around them. This magnetized layer at the cloud-halo
interface can suppress the mixing between the cloud and the surrounding halo
gas. For simplicity, many earlier numerical studies adopt spherically symmetric
uniform-density clouds as initial conditions. However, observations of HVCs
indicate that the clouds are clumpy and turbulent. In this paper, we perform 3D
magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the evolution of clouds with more a
realistic initial density distribution. In the parameter regime of our models,
simple spherical clouds only grow from the onset of the simulations, while
clumpy clouds lose cold gas at early times and then start to grow unless they
have very low metallicity. Some massive clumps composing a clumpy cloud share
broad similarities with single uniform-density clouds in that they have clear
head-tail morphology and magnetic fields draped around themselves. Such
similarities are marginal among clumps in the wake of the cloud. With magnetic
fields present, the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities is suppressed along
the direction of the cloud's motion. Efficient radiative cooling leads to a
compact cloud with rich clumps and filaments condensed from the surrounding
gas. The slope of the initial density power spectrum is closely related to the
density contrast within a clumpy cloud. It, therefore, determines how fast the
material is pushed out of the initial cloud and mixed with the halo gas.
