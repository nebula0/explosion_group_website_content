 SS433 is a Galactic microquasar with powerful outflows (double jet, accretion
disk and winds) with well known orbital, precessional and nutational period. In
this work we characterise different outflow parameters throughout the
precessional cycle of the system. We analyse 10 NuSTAR ($3-70$ keV)
observations of $\sim$30~ks that span $\sim$1.5 precessional cycles. We extract
averaged spectra and model them using a combination of a double thermal jet
model (bjet) and pure neutral and relativistic reflection (xillverCp and
relxilllpCp) over an accretion disk. We find an average jet bulk velocity of
$\beta = v/c \sim0.29$ with an opening angle of $\lesssim$6~degrees. Eastern
jet kinetic power ranges from 1 to $10^{39}$~erg/s, with base "coronal"
temperatures $T_o$ ranging between 14 and 18 keV. Nickel to iron abundances
remain constant at $\sim$9 (within 1$\sigma$). The western to eastern jet flux
ratio becomes $\sim1$ on intermediate phases, about 35% of the total
precessional orbit. The $3-70$ keV total unabsorbed luminosity of the jet and
disk ranges from 2 to 20 $\times$10$^{37}$~erg/s, with the disk reflection
component contributing mainly to the hard $20-30$ keV excess and the stationary
6.7 keV ionized Fe line complex. At low opening angles $\Theta$ we find that
the jet expands sideways following an adiabatic expansion of a gas with
temperature $T_o$. Finally, the central source and lower parts of the jet could
be hidden by an optically thick region of $\tau > 0.1$ and size $R\sim
N_H/n_{e0}\sim1.5\times10^9$~cm$\sim$1700~$r_g$ for $M_{BH}=3~M_{\odot}$
