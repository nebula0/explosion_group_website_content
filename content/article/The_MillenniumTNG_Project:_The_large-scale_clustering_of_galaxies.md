 Modern redshift surveys are tasked with mapping out the galaxy distribution
over enormous distance scales. Existing hydrodynamical simulations, however, do
not reach the volumes needed to match upcoming surveys. We present results for
the clustering of galaxies using a new, large volume hydrodynamical simulation
as part of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project. With a computational volume that
is $\approx15$ times larger than the next largest such simulation currently
available, we show that MTNG is able to accurately reproduce the observed
clustering of galaxies as a function of stellar mass. When separated by colour,
there are some discrepancies with respect to the observed population, which can
be attributed to the quenching of satellite galaxies in our model. We combine
MTNG galaxies with those generated using a semi-analytic model to emulate the
sample selection of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and emission line galaxies
(ELGs), and show that although the bias of these populations is approximately
(but not exactly) constant on scales larger than $\approx10$ Mpc, there is
significant scale-dependent bias on smaller scales. The amplitude of this
effect varies between the two galaxy types, and also between the semi-analytic
model and MTNG. We show that this is related to the distribution of haloes
hosting LRGs and ELGs. Using mock SDSS-like catalogues generated on MTNG
lightcones, we demonstrate the existence of prominent baryonic acoustic
features in the large-scale galaxy clustering. We also demonstrate the presence
of realistic redshift space distortions in our mocks, finding excellent
agreement with the multipoles of the redshift-space clustering measured in SDSS
data.
