 A tantalizing enigma in extragalactic astronomy concerns the chronology and
driving mechanisms of the build-up of late-type galaxies (LTGs). The standard
scenario envisages two formation routes, with classical bulges (CBs) assembling
first in a quick quasi-monolithic episode followed by gradual disk assembly,
and pseudo-bulges (PBs) forming over the Gyr-long secular evolution of LTGs.
The expectation is, therefore, the segregation of present-day LTG bulges into
two distinct groups. Here we analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of
bulges and disks for 135 LTGs from the CALIFA survey covering the relevant
range in LTG mass. In addition, their physical properties were contrasted with
predictions from evolutionary synthesis models, adopting exponentially
declining SFHs, with an e-folding time 0.1 < $\tau$ < 20 Gyr. Analysis of the
SFHs of ~ half-million spaxels consistently reveals that the main properties of
bulges and disks show a continuous distribution across total stellar mass.
Moreover, the $\tau$ in high-mass LTGs radially increases, suggesting that
these grow in an inside-out fashion, while lower-mass LTGs display roughly the
same $\tau$ throughout their entire radial extent. Evolutionary synthesis
predictions are consistent with observations. Finally, bulges and disks of
higher mass LTGs exhibit shorter formation timescales as compared to their
lower mass counterparts. Collectively, the obtained results evince a coherent
and unified picture for the formation and evolution of LTGs, in which PBs and
CBs denote extremities of a continuous sequence. This analysis is consistent
with the framework where bulges are assembled with their parent disks by
gradual inside-out growth, at a pace that is regulated by the depth of the
galactic potential. In accordance is the utter absence of bimodal correlations,
as expected if CBs and PBs were to emerge from two distinct formation routes.
