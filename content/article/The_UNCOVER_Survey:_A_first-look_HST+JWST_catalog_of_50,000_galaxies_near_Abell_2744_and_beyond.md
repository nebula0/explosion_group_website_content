 In November 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) returned deep
near-infrared images of Abell~2744 -- a powerful lensing cluster capable of
magnifying distant, incipient galaxies beyond it. Together with the existing
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available dataset opens a
fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the
formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect
and measure some 50,000 objects across the 45 arcmin$^2$ JWST footprint down to
a $5\,\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim$29.9\,mag in 0.32" apertures.
Photometry is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point
spread function of the reddest NIRCam band, F444W, and cleaned of bright
cluster galaxies and the related intra-cluster light. To give an impression of
the photometric performance, we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a
$\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.03$ based on known, but relatively small,
spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release HST and JWST
PSF-matched photometric catalogs optimized for bright and extended sources
(0.7" apertures) and compact and faint sources (0.32" apertures) along with
basic photometric redshifts, rest-frame colors, and individual magnification
estimates. These catalogs will set the stage for efficient and deep
spectroscopic follow-up of the first JWST-selected samples in Summer 2023.
