 Astronomical observations strongly incompatible with the canonical
cosmological model are reviewed. In particular too early formation of galaxies,
as discovered by HST and JWST, are discussed in detail. Other data revealing
highly dense population of the very young universe with plethora of other
different types of objects are presented. It is demonstrated that similar or
maybe even more pronounced problems can be seen also in the present day
universe. It is argued that all of the above mentioned problems can be nicely
fixed by assumption that the universe is filled with primordial black holes in
wide mass interval from a fraction of the solar mass up to supermassive BH. The
mechanism of PBH formation presented in 1993 is described. The predicted by
this mechanism log-normal mass spectrum of such PBH is shown to agree very well
with the data. Finally possible rich population of our Galaxy by antimatter is
discussed and new ways of its identification are presented
