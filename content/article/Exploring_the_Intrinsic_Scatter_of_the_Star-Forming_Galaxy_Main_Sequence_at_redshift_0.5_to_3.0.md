 Previous studies have shown that the normalization and scatter of the galaxy
'main sequence' (MS), the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and
stellar mass ($M_*$), evolves over cosmic time. However, such studies often
rely on photometric redshifts and/or only rest-frame UV to near-IR data, which
may underestimate the SFR and $M_*$ uncertainties. We use MAGPHYS+photo-z to
fit the UV to radio spectral energy distributions of 12,380 galaxies in the
COSMOS field at $0.5<z<3.0$ and self-consistently include photometric redshift
uncertainties on the derived SFR and $M_*$. We quantify the effect on the
observed MS scatter from (1) photometric redshift uncertainties (which are
minor) and (2) fitting only rest-frame ultraviolet to near-infrared
observations (which are severe). At fixed redshift and $M_*$, we find that the
intrinsic MS scatter for our sample of galaxies is 1.4 to 2.6 times larger than
the measurement uncertainty. The average intrinsic MS scatter has decreased by
0.1 dex from $z=0.5$ to $\sim2.0$. At low-$z$, the trend between the intrinsic
MS scatter and $M_*$ follows a functional form similar to an inverse stellar
mass-halo mass relation (SMHM; $M_*$/$M_{\rm halo}$ vs $M_*$), with a minimum
in intrinsic MS scatter at log($M_*/M_{\odot})\sim10.25$ and larger scatter at
both lower and higher $M_*$; while this distribution becomes flatter for
high-$z$. The SMHM is thought to be a consequence of feedback effects and this
similarity may suggest a link between galaxy feedback and the intrinsic MS
scatter. These results favor a slight evolution in the intrinsic MS scatter
with both redshift and mass.
