 We study the relation between halo concentration and mass (c-M relation)
using the Seventh and Eighth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS
DR7 and DR8) galaxy catalogue. Assuming that the satellite galaxies follow the
distribution of dark matter, we derive the halo concentration by fitting the
satellite radial profile with a Nararro Frank and White (NFW) format. The
derived c-M relation covers a wide halo mass range from $10^{11.6}$ to
$10^{14.1} \rm\ M_\odot$. We confirm the anti-correlation between the halo mass
and concentration as predicted in cosmological simulations. Our results are in
good agreement with those derived using galaxy dynamics and gravitational
lensing for halos of $10^{11.6}-10^{12.9} \rm\ M_\odot$, while they are
slightly lower for halos of $10^{12.9}-10^{14.1}\rm\ M_\odot$. It is because
blue satellite galaxies are less concentrated, especially in the inner regions.
Instead of using all satellite galaxies, red satellites could be better tracers
of the underlying dark matter distribution in galaxy groups.
