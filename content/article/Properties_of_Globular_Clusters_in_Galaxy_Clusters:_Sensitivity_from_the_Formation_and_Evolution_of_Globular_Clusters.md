 We investigate the properties of globular clusters in a galaxy cluster, using
the particle tagging method with a semi-analytical approach in a cosmological
context. We assume globular clusters form from dark matter halo mergers and
their metallicity is assigned based on the stellar mass of the host dark matter
halos and the formation redshift of GCs. Dynamical evolution and disruption of
globular clusters are considered using semi-analytical approaches, controlled
by several free parameters. In this paper, we investigate how our results are
changed by the choice of free parameters. We compare our fiducial results with
representative observations, including the mass ratio between the globular
cluster system and its host galaxy, the globular cluster occupancy, the number
fraction of blue globular clusters, and the metallicity gradient with the
globular cluster mass. Because we can know the positions of globular clusters
with time, comparison with additional observations is possible, e.g., the
median radii of the globular cluster system in individual galaxies, the mean
projected density profiles of intracluster globular clusters, and metallicity
and age gradients of globular clusters with a clustercentric radius. We also
find that the specific mass of the globular cluster system in each galaxy is
different with a clustercentric radius.
