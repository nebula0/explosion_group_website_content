 Studying coupling between different galactic components is a challenging
problem in galactic dynamics. Using basis function expansions (BFEs) and
multichannel singular spectrum analysis (mSSA) as a means of dynamical data
mining, we discover evidence for two multi-component disc-halo dipole modes in
a Milky-Way-like simulated galaxy. One of the modes grows throughout the
simulation, while the other decays throughout the simulation. The
multi-component disc-halo modes are driven primarily by the halo, and have
implications for the structural evolution of galaxies, including observations
of lopsidedness and other non-axisymmetric structure. In our simulation, the
modes create surface density features up to 10 per cent relative to the
equilibrium model stellar disc. While the simulated galaxy was constructed to
be in equilibrium, BFE+mSSA also uncovered evidence of persistent periodic
signals incited by aphysical initial conditions disequilibrium, including rings
and weak two-armed spirals, both at the 1 per cent level. The method is
sensitive to distinct evolutionary features at and even below the 1 per cent
level of surface density variation. The use of mSSA produced clean signals for
both modes and disequilibrium, efficiently removing variance owing to estimator
noise from the input BFE time series. The discovery of multi-component
halo-disc modes is strong motivation for application of BFE+mSSA to the rich
zoo of dynamics of multi-component interacting galaxies.
