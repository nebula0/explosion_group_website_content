 We develop a method to identify and determine the physical properties of
stellar associations using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NUV-U-B-V-I imaging of
nearby galaxies from the PHANGS-HST survey. We apply a watershed algorithm to
density maps constructed from point source catalogues Gaussian smoothed to
multiple physical scales from 8 to 64 pc. We develop our method on two galaxies
that span the distance range in the PHANGS-HST sample: NGC 3351 (10 Mpc), NGC
1566 (18 Mpc). We test our algorithm with different parameters such as the
choice of detection band for the point source catalogue (NUV or V), source
density image filtering methods, and absolute magnitude limits. We characterise
the properties of the resulting multi-scale associations, including sizes,
number of tracer stars, number of associations, photometry, as well as ages,
masses, and reddening from Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. Our method
successfully identifies structures that occupy loci in the UBVI colour-colour
diagram consistent with previously published catalogues of clusters and
associations. The median ages of the associations increases from log(age/yr) =
6.6 to log(age/yr) = 6.9 as the spatial scale increases from 8 pc to 64 pc for
both galaxies. We find that the youngest stellar associations, with ages < 3
Myr, indeed closely trace H ii regions in H$\alpha$ imaging, and that older
associations are increasingly anti-correlated with the H$\alpha$ emission.
Owing to our new method, the PHANGS-HST multi-scale associations provide a far
more complete census of recent star formation activity than found with previous
cluster and compact association catalogues. The method presented here will be
applied to the full sample of 38 PHANGS-HST galaxies.
