 Observational searches for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $10^2 -
10^6$ $M_\odot$) include relatively isolated dwarf galaxies. For those that
host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the IMBH nature may be discerned through
the accretion - jet activity. We present radio observations of four AGN-hosting
dwarf galaxies (which potentially harbor IMBHs). Very large array (VLA)
observations indicate steep spectra (indices of $-$0.63 to $-$1.05) between 1.4
and 9 GHz. A comparison with the 9 GHz in-band spectral index however shows a
steepening for GH047 and GH158 (implying older/relic emission) and flattening
for GH106 and GH163 (implying recent activity). Overlapping emission regions in
the VLA 1.4 GHz and our very long baseline array (VLBA) 1.5 GHz observations,
and possibly symmetric pc-scale extensions are consistent with recent activity
in the latter two. Using the compact VLBA radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity
(probing the accretion activity) and the black hole masses, all AGNs are found
to lie on the empirical fundamental plane relation. The four AGN are radio
quiet with relatively higher Eddington ratios ($0.04 - 0.32$) and resemble the
X-ray binaries during spectral state transitions that entail an outflow
ejection. Furthermore, the radio to X-ray luminosity ratio $\log{R_\mathrm{X}}$
of $-3.9$ to $-5.6$ in these four sources support the scenarios including
corona mass ejection from accretion disk and wind activity. The growth to
kpc-scales likely proceeds along a trajectory similar to young AGNs and peaked
spectrum sources. The above complex clues can thus aid in the detection and
monitoring of IMBHs in the nearby Universe.
