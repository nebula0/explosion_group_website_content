 We present an 870 $\mu$m continuum survey of 300 protostars from the Herschel
Orion Protostar Survey (HOPS) using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). These data
measure protostellar flux densities on envelope scales $\le$ 8000 AU (20") and
resolve the structure of envelopes with 1600 AU (4") resolution, a factor of
3-5 improvement in angular resolution over existing single dish 870 $\mu$m
observations. We compare the ACA observations to Atacama Large Millimeter Array
(ALMA) 12m array observations at 870 $\mu$m with $\sim$0.1" (40 AU) resolution.
Using the 12 meter data to measure the fluxes from disks and the ACA fluxes
within 2500 au to measure the combined disk plus envelope fluxes, we calculate
the 12 m/ACA 870 $\mu$m flux ratios. Our sample shows a clear evolution in this
ratio. Class 0 protostars are mostly envelope-dominated with ratios $<$ 0.5. In
contrast, Flat Spectrum protostars are primarily disk-dominated with ratios
near one, although with a number of face-on protostars with large envelopes.
Class I protostars span the range from envelope to disk dominated. The increase
in ratio is accompanied by a decrease in the envelope fluxes and estimated mass
infall rates. We estimate that 80% of the mass is accreted during the
envelope-dominated phase. We find that the 12m/ACA flux ratio is an
evolutionary indicator that largely avoids the inclination and foreground
extinction dependence of SED-based indicators.
