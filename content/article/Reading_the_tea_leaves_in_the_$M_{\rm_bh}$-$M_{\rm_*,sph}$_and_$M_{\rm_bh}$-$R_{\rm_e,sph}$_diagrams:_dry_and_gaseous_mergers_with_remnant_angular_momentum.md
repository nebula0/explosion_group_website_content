 We recently revealed that bulges and elliptical galaxies broadly define
distinct, super-linear relations in the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm *,sph}$ diagram,
with the order-of-magnitude lower $M_{\rm bh}/M_{\rm *,sph}$ ratios in the
elliptical galaxies due to major (disc-destroying, elliptical-building) dry
mergers. Building on this, here we present a more nuanced picture. Galaxy
mergers, in which the net orbital angular momentum does not cancel, can lead to
systems with a rotating disc. This situation can occur with either wet
(gas-rich) mergers involving one or two spiral galaxies, e.g., NGC 5128, or dry
(gas-poor) collisions involving one or two lenticular galaxies, e.g., NGC 5813.
The spheroid and disc masses of the progenitor galaxies and merger remnant
dictate the shift in the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm *,sph}$ and $M_{\rm bh}$-$R_{\rm
e,sph}$ diagrams. We show how this explains the (previously excluded merger
remnant) S\'ersic S0 galaxies near the bottom of the elliptical sequence and
core-S\'ersic S0 galaxies at the top of the bulge sequence, neither of which
are faded spiral galaxies. We also introduce two ellicular (ES) galaxy types,
explore the location of brightest cluster galaxies and stripped `compact
elliptical' galaxies in the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm *,sph}$ diagram, and present a
new merger-built $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm *,sph}$ relation which may prove helpful
for studies of nanohertz gravitational waves. This work effectively brings into
the fold many systems previously considered outliers with either overly massive
or undermassive black holes relative to the near-linear $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm
*,sph}$ `red sequence' patched together with select bulges and elliptical
galaxies.
