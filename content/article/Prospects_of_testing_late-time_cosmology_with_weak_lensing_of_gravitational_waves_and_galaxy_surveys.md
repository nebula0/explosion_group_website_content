 We investigate the synergy of upcoming galaxy surveys and gravitational wave
(GW) experiments in constraining late-time cosmology, examining the
cross-correlations between the weak lensing of gravitational waves (GW-WL) and
the galaxy fields. Without focusing on any specific GW detector configuration,
we benchmark the requirements for the high-precision measurement of
cosmological parameters by considering several scenarios, varying the number of
detected GW events and the uncertainty on the inference of the source
luminosity distance and redshift. We focus on $\Lambda$CDM and scalar-tensor
cosmologies, using the Effective Field Theory formalism as a unifying language.
We find that, in some of the explored setups, GW-WL contributes to the galaxy
signal by doubling the accuracy on non-$\Lambda$CDM parameters, allowing in the
most favourable scenarios to reach even percent and sub-percent level bounds.
Though the most extreme cases presented here are likely beyond the
observational capabilities of currently planned individual GW detectors, we
show nonetheless that - provided that enough statistics of events can be
accumulated - GW-WL offers the potential to become a cosmological probe
complementary to LSS surveys, particularly for those parameters that cannot be
constrained by other GW probes such as standard sirens.
