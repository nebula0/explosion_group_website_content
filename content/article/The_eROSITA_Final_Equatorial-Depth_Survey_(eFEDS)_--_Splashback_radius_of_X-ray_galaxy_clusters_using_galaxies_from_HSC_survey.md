 We present the splashback radius measurements around the SRG/eROSITA eFEDS
X-ray selected galaxy clusters by cross-correlating them with HSC S19A
photometric galaxies. The X-ray selection is expected to be less affected by
systematics related to projection that affects optical cluster finder
algorithms. We use a nearly volume-limited X-ray cluster sample selected in
0.5-2.0 keV band having luminosity $L_X > 10^{43.5} {\rm erg s^{-1} h^{-2}}$
within the redshift $z<0.75$ and obtain measurements of the projected
cross-correlation with a signal-to-noise of $17.43$. We model our measurements
to infer a three-dimensional profile and find that the steepest slope is
sharper than $-3$ and associate the location with the splashback radius. We
infer the value of the 3D splashback radius $r_{\rm sp} =
1.45^{+0.30}_{-0.26}\,{\rm h^{-1} Mpc}$. We also measure the weak lensing
signal of the galaxy clusters and obtain halo mass $\log[M_{\rm 200m}/{\rm
h^{-1}M_\odot}] = 14.52 \pm 0.06$ using the HSC-S16A shape catalogue data at
the median redshift $z=0.46$ of our cluster sample. We compare our $r_{\rm sp}$
values with the spherical overdensity boundary $r_{\rm 200m} = 1.75 \pm
0.08\,{\rm h^{-1} Mpc}$ based on the halo mass which is consistent within
$1.2\sigma$ with the $\Lambda$CDM predictions. Our constraints on the
splashback radius, although broad, are the best measurements thus far obtained
for an X-ray selected galaxy cluster sample.
