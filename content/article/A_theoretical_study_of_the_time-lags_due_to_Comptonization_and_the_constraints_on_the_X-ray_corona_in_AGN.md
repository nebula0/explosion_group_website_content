 We study the Fourier time-lags due to the Comptonization of disc-emitted
photons in a spherical, uniform, and stationary X-ray corona, which located on
the rotational axis of the black hole. We use Monk, a general relativistic
Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, to calculate Compton scattering of photons
emitted by a thin disc with a Novikov-Thorne temperature profile. We find that
the model time-lags due to Comptonization remain constant up to a
characteristic frequency and then rapidly decrease to zero at higher
frequencies. We provide equations which can be used to determine the time-lags
and cross spectra for a wide range of values for the corona radius,
temperature, optical depth, height, and for various accretion rates and black
hole masses. We also provide an equation for the X-ray luminosity of a single
corona, as a function of the its characteristics and location above the disc.
Remarkably, the observed X-ray time-lags of nearby, bright active galaxies can
be successfully reproduced by inverse Comptonization process of multiple
dynamic coronae.
