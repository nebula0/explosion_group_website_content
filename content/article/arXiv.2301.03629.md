        We present a free-form model of SMACS0723, the first cluster observed with JWST. This model makes no strong assumptions about the distribution of mass (mostly dark matter) in the cluster and we use it to study the possible correlation between dark matter with the intracluster light and distribution of globular clusters. To explore the uncertainty in mass modelling, we derive three lens models based on spectroscopically confirmed systems and new candidate systems with redshifts predicted by the lens model derived from the spectroscopic systems. We find that beyond the radius of influence of the BCG, the total mass does not trace the ICL, implying the need for a dark component (dark matter). Two loop-like structures observed in the intracluster light do not have an obvious correspondence with the total mass (mostly dark matter) distribution. The radial profiles of the ICL and the distribution of globular clusters are similar to each other, but steeper than the profile of the lens model. More specifically, we find that the total mass is shallower by 1 dex in log scale than both ICL and globular cluster profiles. This is in excellent agreement with N-body simulations of cold dark matter.
