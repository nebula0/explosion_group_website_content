 In black hole X-ray binaries, a non-thermal high-energy component is
sometimes detected at energies above 200 keV. The origin of this component is
debated and distinct spectral modelizations can lead to different
interpretations. High-energy polarimetry measurements with INTEGRAL allow new
diagnostics on the physics responsible for the MeV spectral component. In this
work, we aim to investigate the high-energy behavior of three bright sources
discovered by the MAXI: MAXI J1535-571, MAXI J1820+070 and MAXI J1348-630. We
take advantage of their brightness to investigate their soft gamma-ray (0.1-2
MeV) properties with INTEGRAL. We use both spectral and polarimetric approaches
to probe their high-energy emission with the aim to bring new constraints on
the ~ MeV emission. We first study the spectral characteristics of the sources
in the 3-2000 keV using JEM-X, IBIS and SPI with a semi-phenomenological
description of the data. We then use IBIS as a Compton telescope in order to
evaluate the polarization properties of the sources above 300 keV.
  A high-energy component is detected during the HIMS and SIMS of MAXI
J1535-571, the LHS of MAXI J1820+070 and the LHS of MAXI J1348-630. The
components detected in MAXI J1820+070 and MAXI J1348-630 are polarized with a
polarization fraction of 26 +/- 9{\deg} and > 56 % in the 300-1000 keV,
respectively. With no polarization information for MAXI J1535-571, the
component detected could either come from the jets or the corona. In the case
of MAXI J1820+070, the extrapolation of the synchrotron spectrum measured in
the infrared indicates that the component is likely due to a non-thermal
distribution of electrons from a hybrid corona. For MAXI J1348-630, the high
fraction of polarization points towards a jets origin, however, we cannot
formally conclude without any infrared data giving information on the optically
thin part of the synchrotron spectrum.
