 Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) mark the explosive death of red supergiants
(RSGs), evolved massive stars with an extended hydrogen envelope. They are the
most common supernova type and allow for benchmarking of supernova explosion
models by statistical comparison to observed population properties rather than
comparing individual models and events. We construct a large synthetic set of
SNe IIP light curves (LCs) using the radiation hydrodynamics code \texttt{SNEC}
and explosion energies and nickel masses obtained from an efficient
semi-analytic model for two different sets of stellar progenitor models. By
direct comparison we demonstrate that the semi-analytic model yields very
similar predictions as alternative phenomenological explosion models based on
one-dimensional simulations. We find systematic differences of a factor of
$\mathord{\sim}2$ in plateau luminosities between the two progenitor sets due
to different stellar radii, which highlights the importance of the RSG envelope
structure as a major uncertainty in interpreting LCs of SNe IIP. A comparison
to a volume-limited sample of observed SNe IIP shows decent agreement in
plateau luminosity, plateau duration and nickel mass for at least one of the
synthetic LC sets. The models, however, do not produce sufficient events with
very small nickel mass $M_\mathrm{Ni}<0.01\,M_\odot$ and predict an
anticorrelation between plateau luminosity and plateau duration that is not
present in the observed sample, a result that warrants further study. Our
results suggest that a better understanding of RSG stellar structure is no less
important for reliably explaining the light curves of SNe IIP than the
explosion physics.
