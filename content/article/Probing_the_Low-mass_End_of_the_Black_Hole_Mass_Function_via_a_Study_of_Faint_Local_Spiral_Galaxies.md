 We present an analysis of the pitch angle distribution function (PADF) for
nearby galaxies and its resulting black hole mass function (BHMF) via the
well-known relationship between pitch angle and black hole mass. Our sample
consists of a subset of 74 spiral galaxies from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy
Survey with absolute $B$-band magnitude $\mathfrak{M}_{B}>-19.12$ mag and
luminosity distance $D_{\mathrm{L}} \leq 25.4$ Mpc, which is an extension of a
complementary set of 140 more luminous ($\mathfrak{M}_{B}\leq-19.12$ mag)
late-type galaxies. We find the PADFs of the two samples are, somewhat
surprisingly, not strongly dissimilar; a result that may hold important
implications for spiral formation theories. Our data show a distinct bimodal
population manifest in the pitch angles of the Sa-Sc types and separately the
Scd-Sm types, with Sa-Sc types having tighter spiral arms on average.
Importantly, we uncover a distinct bifurcation of the BHMF, such that the Sa-Sc
galaxies typically host so-called "supermassive" black holes
($M_{\bullet}\gtrsim10^6\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), whereas Scd-Sm galaxies
accordingly harbor black holes that are "less-than-supermassive"
($M_{\bullet}\lesssim10^6\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). It is amongst this latter
population of galaxies where we expect fruitful bounties of elusive
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), through which a better understanding
will help form more precise benchmarks for future generations of gravitational
wave detectors.
