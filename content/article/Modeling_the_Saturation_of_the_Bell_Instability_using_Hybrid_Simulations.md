 The nonresonant streaming instability (Bell instability) plays a pivotal role
in the acceleration and confinement of cosmic rays (CRs); yet, the exact
mechanism responsible for its saturation and the magnitude of the final
amplified magnetic field have not been assessed from first-principles. Using a
survey of hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we study
the evolution of the Bell instability as a function of the parameters of the CR
population. We find that, at saturation, the magnetic pressure in the amplified
field is comparable with the initial CR momentum flux (i.e., the anisotropic CR
pressure). These results provide a predictive prescription for the total
magnetic field amplification expected in the many astrophysical environments
where the Bell instability is important.
