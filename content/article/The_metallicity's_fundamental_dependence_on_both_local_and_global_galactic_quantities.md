 We study the scaling relations between gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass
surface density ($\Sigma _*$), star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma
_{SFR}$), and molecular gas surface density ($\Sigma_{H_2}$) in local
star-forming galaxies on scales of a kpc. We employ optical integral field
spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, and ALMA data for a subset of MaNGA
galaxies. We use Partial Correlation Coefficients and Random Forest regression
to determine the relative importance of local and global galactic properties in
setting the gas-phase metallicity. We find that the local metallicity depends
primarily on $\Sigma _*$ (the resolved mass-metallicity relation, rMZR), and
has a secondary anti-correlation with $\Sigma _{SFR}$ (i.e. a
spatially-resolved version of the `Fundamental Metallicity Relation', rFMR). We
find that $\Sigma_{H_2}$ has little effect in determining the local
metallicity. This result indicates that gas accretion, resulting in local
metallicity dilution and local boosting of star formation, cannot be the
primary origin of the rFMR. Star-formation driven, metal-loaded winds may
contribute to the anti-correlation between metallicity and SFR. The local
metallicity depends also on the global properties of galaxies. We find a strong
dependence on the total stellar mass ($M_*$) and a weaker (inverse) dependence
on the total SFR. The global metallicity scaling relations, therefore, do not
simply stem out of their resolved counterparts; global properties and
processes, such as the global gravitational potential well, galaxy-scale winds
and global redistribution/mixing of metals, likely contribute to the local
metallicity, in addition to local production and retention.
