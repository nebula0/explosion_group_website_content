 Young eclipsing binaries (EBs) are powerful probes of early stellar
evolution. Current models are unable to simultaneously reproduce the measured
and derived properties that are accessible for EB systems (e.g., mass, radius,
temperature, luminosity). In this study we add a benchmark EB to the pre-main
sequence population with our characterization of TOI 450 (TIC 77951245). Using
\gaia\ astrometry to identify its comoving, coeval companions, we confirm TOI
450 is a member of the $\sim$40 Myr Columba association. This eccentric
($e=0.2969$), equal-mass ($q=1.000$) system provides only one grazing eclipse.
Despite this, our analysis achieves the precision of a double-eclipsing system
by leveraging information in our high-resolution spectra to place priors on the
surface-brightness and radius ratios. We also introduce a framework to include
the effect of star spots on the observed eclipse depths. Multi-color eclipse
light curves play a critical role in breaking degeneracies between the effects
of star spots and limb-darkening. Including star spots reduces the derived
radii by $\sim$2\% from a unspotted model ($>2\sigma$) and inflates the formal
uncertainty in accordance with our lack of knowledge regarding the star spot
orientation. We derive masses of 0.1768($\pm$0.0004) and 0.1767($\pm$0.0003)
$M_\odot$, and radii of 0.345($\pm$0.006) and 0.346($\pm$0.006) $R_\odot$ for
the primary and secondary, respectively. We compare these measurements to
multiple stellar evolution isochones, finding good agreement with the
association age. The MESA MIST and SPOTS ($f_{\rm s}=0.17$) isochrones perform
the best across our comparisons, but detailed agreement depends heavily on the
quantities being compared.
