 The Canadian Hydrogen Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a radio telescope located
in British Columbia, Canada. The large field of view (FOV) of $\sim$ 200 square
degrees has enabled the CHIME/FRB instrument to produce the largest FRB catalog
to date. The large FOV also allows CHIME/FRB to be an exceptional pulsar and
Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) finding machine, despite saving only the
metadata information of incoming Galactic events. We have developed a pipeline
to search for pulsars/RRATs using DBSCAN, a clustering algorithm. Output
clusters are then inspected by a human for pulsar/RRAT candidates and follow-up
observations are scheduled with the more sensitive CHIME/Pulsar instrument. The
CHIME/Pulsar instrument is capable of a near-daily search mode observation
cadence. We have thus developed the CHIME/Pulsar Single Pulse Pipeline to
automate the processing of CHIME/Pulsar search mode data. We report the
discovery of 21 new Galactic sources, with 14 RRATs, 6 regular slow pulsars and
1 binary system. Owing to CHIME/Pulsar's daily observations we have obtained
timing solutions for 8 of the 14 RRATs along with all the regular pulsars. This
demonstrates CHIME/Pulsar's ability at finding timing solutions for transient
sources.
