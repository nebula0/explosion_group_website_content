 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has provided
photometric light curves for stars across nearly the entire sky. This allows
for the application of asteroseismology to a pool of potential solar-like
oscillators that is unprecedented in size. We aim to produce a catalogue of
solar-like oscillators observed by TESS in the 120-second and 20-second cadence
modes. The catalogue is intended to highlight stars oscillating at frequencies
above the TESS 30-minute cadence Nyquist frequency with the purpose of
encompassing the main sequence and subgiant evolutionary phases. We aim to
provide estimates for the global asteroseismic parameters $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$
and $\Delta\nu$. We apply a new probabilistic detection algorithm to the
120-second and 20-second light curves of over 250,000 stars. This algorithm
flags targets that show characteristic signatures of solar-like oscillations.
We manually vet the resulting list of targets to confirm the presence of
solar-like oscillations. Using the probability densities computed by the
algorithm, we measure the global asteroseismic parameters $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$
and $\Delta\nu$. We produce a catalogue of 4,177 solar-like oscillators,
reporting $\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ for $98\%$ of the total star
count. The asteroseismic data reveals vast coverage of the HR diagram,
populating the red giant branch, the subgiant regime and extending toward the
main sequence. A crossmatch with external catalogs shows that 25 of the
detected solar-like oscillators are a component of a spectroscopic binary, and
28 are confirmed planet host stars. These results provide the potential for
precise, independent asteroseismic constraints on these and any additional TESS
targets of interest.
