 We present early science results from Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas
Origins (DINGO), an HI survey using the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (ASKAP). Using ASKAP sub-arrays available during its commissioning
phase, DINGO early science data were taken over $\sim$ 60 deg$^{2}$ of the
Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) 23 h region with 35.5 hr integration time. We
make direct detections of six known and one new sources at $z < 0.01$. Using HI
spectral stacking, we investigate the HI gas content of galaxies at $0.04 < z<
0.09$ for different galaxy colours. The results show that galaxy morphology
based on optical colour is strongly linked to HI gas properties. To examine
environmental impacts on the HI gas content of galaxies, three sub-samples are
made based on the GAMA group catalogue. The average HI mass of group central
galaxies is larger than those of satellite and isolated galaxies, but with a
lower HI gas fraction. We derive a variety of HI scaling relations for physical
properties of our sample, including stellar mass, stellar mass surface density,
$NUV-r$ colour, specific star formation rate, and halo mass. We find that the
derived HI scaling relations are comparable to other published results, with
consistent trends also observed to $\sim$0.5 dex lower limits in stellar mass
and stellar surface density. The cosmic HI densities derived from our data are
consistent with other published values at similar redshifts. DINGO early
science highlights the power of HI spectral stacking techniques with ASKAP.
