 To pinpoint the peak location of the synchrotron total intensity emission in
a spiral arm, we use a map of the spiralarm locations (from the observed arm
tangent). Thus In a typical spiral arm in Galactic Quadrant I, we find the peak
of the synchrotron radiation to be located about 220 +/-40 pc away from the
inner arm edge (hot dust lane) inside the spiral arm. While most of the
galactic disk has a clockwise largescale magnetic field, we make a statistical
analysis to delimitate more precisely the smaller reverse annulus wiith a
counterclockwise galactic magnetic field. We find an annulus width of 2.1
+/-0.3 kpc (measured along the Galactic radius), located from 5.5 to 7.6 kpc
from the Galactic Center). The annulus does not overlay with a single spiral
arm -- it encompasses segments of two different spiral arms. Using a recent
delineation of the position of spiral arms, the field-reversed annulus is seen
to encompass the Crux-Centaurus arm (in Galactic Quadrant IV) and the
Sagittarius arm (in Galactic Quadrant I).
