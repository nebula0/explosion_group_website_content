 The Universe expansion rate is modulated around local inhomogeneities due to
their gravitational potential. Velocity waves are then observed around galaxy
clusters in the Hubble diagram. This paper studies them in a ~738 Mpc wide,
with 2048^3 particles, cosmological simulation of our cosmic environment
(a.k.a. CLONE: Constrained LOcal & Nesting Environment Simulation). For the
first time, the simulation shows that velocity waves that arise in the
lines-of-sight of the most massive dark matter halos agree with those observed
in local galaxy velocity catalogs in the lines-of-sight of Coma and several
other local (Abell) clusters. For the best-constrained clusters such as Virgo
and Centaurus, i.e. those closest to us, secondary waves caused by galaxy
groups, further into the non-linear regime, also stand out. This match is not
utterly expected given that before being evolved into a fully non-linear z=0
state, assuming $\Lambda$CDM, CLONE initial conditions are constrained with
solely linear theory, power spectrum and highly uncertain and sparse local
peculiar velocities. Additionally, Gaussian fits to velocity wave envelopes
show that wave properties are tightly tangled with cluster masses. This link is
complex though and involves the environment and formation history of the
clusters. Using machine learning techniques to grasp more thoroughly the
complex wave-mass relation, velocity waves could in the near future be used to
provide additional and independent mass estimates from galaxy dynamics within
large cluster radii.
