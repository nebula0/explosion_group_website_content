 We have identified 7 objects in Gaia Early DR3 associated with 6
International Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) pulsars. We combine both pulsar timing
based parallax distance measurements with Gaia parallaxes to their companions,
in an effort to improve distance measurements. We confirm previous cross-match
findings for pulsars J0437-4715, J1012+5307, J1024-0719, J1732-5049, and
J1843-1113. We no longer find the companion to J1949+3106 even though it was
detected with a $> 3\sigma$ confidence in Gaia DR2. It is therefore likely that
any definite cross-match must be made with $>3\sigma$ confidence, casting
further doubt on companion identified with J1843-1113. We also report a low
signal-to-noise detection of two candidates matched with J1747-4036 which we
will continue to monitor. Encouragingly, the average signal-to-noise increase
between Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 is $\sim 50\%$, and the errors on the binary
distances have improved by $10\%$.
