 AI super-resolution, combining deep learning and N-body simulations has been
shown to successfully reproduce the large scale structure and halo abundances
in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. Here, we extend its use to
models with a different dark matter content, in this case Fuzzy Dark Matter
(FDM), in the approximation that the difference is encoded in the initial power
spectrum. We focus on redshift z = 2, with simulations that model smaller
scales and lower masses, the latter by two orders of magnitude, than has been
done in previous AI super-resolution work. We find that the super-resolution
technique can reproduce the power spectrum and halo mass function to within a
few percent of full high resolution calculations. We also find that halo
artifacts, caused by spurious numerical fragmentation of filaments, are equally
present in the super-resolution outputs. Although we have not trained the
super-resolution algorithm using full quantum pressure FDM simulations, the
fact that it performs well at the relevant length and mass scales means that it
has promise as technique which could avoid the very high computational cost of
the latter, in some contexts. We conclude that AI super-resolution can become a
useful tool to extend the range of dark matter models covered in mock catalogs.
