 A supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $\sim 3\times 10^6 \, \rm M_\odot$ was
recently detected via dynamical measurements at the center of the dwarf galaxy
Leo I. Standing $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude above standard scaling relations,
this SMBH is hosted by a galaxy devoid of gas and with no significant star
formation in the last $\sim 1$ Gyr. This detection can profoundly impact the
formation models for black holes and their hosts. We propose that winds from a
population of $\sim 100$ evolved stars within the Bondi radius of the SMBH
produce a sizable accretion rate, with Eddington ratios between
$9\times10^{-8}$ and $9\times10^{-7}$, depending on the value of the stellar
mass loss. These rates are typical of SMBHs accreting in advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF) mode. The predicted spectrum peaks in the microwaves at
$\sim 0.1-1$ THz ($300-3000 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$) and exhibits significant
variations at higher energies depending on the accretion rate. We predict a
radio flux of $\sim 0.1$ mJy at $6$ GHz, mildly dependent on the accretion
properties. Deep imaging with Chandra, VLA, and ALMA can confirm the presence
of this SMBH and constrain its accretion flow.
