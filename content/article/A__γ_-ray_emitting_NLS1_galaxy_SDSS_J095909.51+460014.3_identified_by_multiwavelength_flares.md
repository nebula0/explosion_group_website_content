 We report on the identification of a new $\gamma$-ray emitting narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxy ($\gamma$-NLS1), SDSS J095909.51+460014.3 (hereinafter
J0959+4600, $z$ = 0.399), by establishing its association with a $\gamma$-ray
source 4FGL 0959.6+4606, although its low-energy counterpart was suggested to
be a radio galaxy 2MASX J09591976+4603515 (hereinafter J0959+4603). \emph{WISE}
long-term light curves of these two sources reveal diverse infrared variability
patterns. Violent infrared variations of J0959+4600 with an amplitude up to one
order of magnitude has been detected, while variability is mild for the other
one. More importantly, the peaking time of the infrared flare of J0959+4603 is
coincident with the time of brightening of 4FGL 0959.6+4606. At the same time,
the flux level of J0959+4603 maintains in the quiescent state. A specific
analysis of 15-month Fermi-LAT data, aiming at the high $\gamma$-ray flux
state, yields a significant source (TS =41). The corresponding localization
analysis suggests that only J0959+4600 falls into the uncertainty area, further
supporting the updated association relationship. A broadband spectral energy
distribution of J0959+4600 has been drawn and well described by the classic
single-zone homogeneous leptonic jet model. The jet properties of J0959+4600
are investigated and found to be comparable with other $\gamma$-NLS1s.
