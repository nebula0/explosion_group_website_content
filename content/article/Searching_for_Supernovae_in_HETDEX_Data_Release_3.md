 We have extracted 636 spectra taken at the positions of 583 transient sources
from the third Data Release of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy
eXperiment (HETDEX). The transients were discovered by the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) during 2018 - 2022. The HETDEX spectra are useful to classify a
large number of objects found by photometric surveys for free. We attempt to
explore and classify the spectra by utilizing machine learning (ML) and
template matching techniques. We have identified two transient sources,
ZTF20aatpoos = AT2020fiz and ZTF19abdkelq as supernova candidates. We classify
AT2020fiz as a Type IIP supernova observed ~10 days after explosion, and we
propose ZTF19abdkelq as a likely Type Ia SN caught ~40 days after maximum
light. ZTF photometry of these two sources are consistent with their
classification as supernovae. Beside these two objects, we have confirmed
several ZTF transients as variable AGNs based on their spectral appearance, and
also determined the host galaxy types for several other ZTF transients.
