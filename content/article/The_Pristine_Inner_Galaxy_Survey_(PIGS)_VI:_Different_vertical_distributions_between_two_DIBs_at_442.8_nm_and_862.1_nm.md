 Although diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) were discovered over 100 years
ago, for most of them, their origins are still unknown. Investigation on the
correlations between different DIBs is an important way to study the behavior
and distributions of their carriers. Based on stacking thousands of spectra
from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, we study the correlations between two
DIBs at 442.8 nm ($\lambda$442.8) and 862.1 nm ($\lambda$862.1), as well as the
dust grains, in a range of latitude spanning ${\sim}22^{\circ}$
($4^{\circ}\,{<}\,|b|\,{<}\,15^{\circ}$) toward the Galactic center
($|\ell|\,{<}\,11^{\circ}$). Tight linear intensity correlations can be found
between $\lambda$442.8, $\lambda$862.1, and dust grains for
$|b|\,{<}\,12^{\circ}$ or $E(B-V)\,{>}\,0.3$ mag. For $|b|\,{>}\,12^{\circ}$,
$\lambda$442.8 and $\lambda$862.1 present larger relative strength with respect
to the dust grains. A systematic variation of the relative strength between
$\lambda$442.8 and $\lambda$862.1 with $|b|$ and $E(B-V)$ concludes that the
two DIBs do not share a common carrier. Furthermore, the carrier of
$\lambda$862.1 is more abundant at high latitudes than that of $\lambda$442.8.
This work can be treated as an example showing the significance and potentials
to the DIB research covering a large latitude range.
