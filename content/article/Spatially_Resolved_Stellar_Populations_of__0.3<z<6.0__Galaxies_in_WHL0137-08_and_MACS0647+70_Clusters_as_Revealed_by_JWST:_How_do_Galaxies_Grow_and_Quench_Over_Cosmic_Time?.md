 We study the spatially resolved stellar populations of 444 galaxies at
$0.3<z<6.0$ in two clusters (WHL0137-08 and MACS0647+70) and a blank field,
combining imaging data from HST and JWST to perform spatially resolved spectral
energy distribution (SED) modeling using pixedfit. The high spatial resolution
of the imaging data combined with magnification from gravitational lensing in
the cluster fields allows us to resolve some galaxies to sub-kpc scales (for
109 of our galaxies). At redshifts around cosmic noon and higher ($2.5\lesssim
z\lesssim 6.0$), we find mass doubling times to be independent of radius,
inferred from flat specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles and
similarities between the half-mass and half-SFR radii. At lower redshifts
($1.5\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$), a significant fraction of our star-forming
galaxies show evidence for nuclear starbursts, inferred from centrally elevated
sSFR, and a much smaller half-SFR radius compared to the half-mass radius. At
later epochs, we find more galaxies suppress star formation in their center but
are still actively forming stars in the disk. Overall, these trends point
toward a picture of inside-out galaxy growth consistent with theoretical models
and simulations. We also observe a tight relationship between the central mass
surface density and global stellar mass with $\sim 0.38$ dex scatter. Our
analysis demonstrates the potential of spatially resolved SED analysis with
JWST data. Future analysis with larger samples will be able to further explore
the assembly of galaxy mass and the growth of their structures
