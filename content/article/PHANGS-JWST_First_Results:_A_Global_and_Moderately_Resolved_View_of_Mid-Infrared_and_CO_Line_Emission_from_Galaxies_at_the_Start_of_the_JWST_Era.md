 We explore the relationship between mid-infrared (mid-IR) and CO rotational
line emission from massive star-forming galaxies, which is one of the tightest
scalings in the local universe. We assemble a large set of unresolved and
moderately ($\sim 1$ kpc) spatially resolved measurements of CO (1-0) and CO
(2-1) intensity, $I_{\rm CO}$, and mid-IR intensity, $I_{\rm MIR}$, at 8, 12,
22, and 24$\mu$m. The $I_{\rm CO}$ vs. $I_{\rm MIR}$ relationship is reasonably
described by a power law with slopes $0.7{-}1.2$ and normalization $I_{\rm CO}
\sim 1$ K km s$^{-1}$ at $I_{\rm MIR} \sim 1$ MJy sr$^{-1}$. Both the slopes
and intercepts vary systematically with choice of line and band. The comparison
between the relations measured for CO~(1-0) and CO (2-1) allow us to infer that
$R_{21} \propto I_{\rm MIR}^{0.2}$, in good agreement with other work. The
$8\mu$m and $12\mu$m bands, with strong PAH features, show steeper CO vs.
mid-IR slopes than the $22\mu$m and $24\mu$m, consistent with PAH emission
arising not just from CO-bright gas but also from atomic or CO-dark gas. The
CO-to-mid-IR ratio correlates with global galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) and
anti-correlates with SFR/$M_\star$. At $\sim 1$ kpc resolution, the first four
PHANGS-JWST targets show CO to mid-IR relationships that are quantitatively
similar to our larger literature sample, including showing the steep
CO-to-mid-IR slopes for the JWST PAH-tracing bands, although we caution that
these initial data have a small sample size and span a limited range of
intensities.
