 Could new physics break the mirror symmetry of the Universe? Utilizing recent
measurements of the parity-odd four-point correlation function of BOSS
galaxies, we probe the physics of inflation by placing constraints on the
amplitude of a number of parity-violating models. Within canonical models of
(single-field, slow-roll) inflation, no parity-asymmetry can occur; however, it
has recently been shown that breaking of the standard assumptions can lead to
parity violation within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFTI). In
particular, we consider the Ghost Condensate and Cosmological Collider
scenarios - the former for the leading and subleading operators in the EFTI and
the latter for different values of mass and speed of an exchanged spin-$1$
particle - for a total of $18$ models. Each instance yields a definite
prediction for the inflationary trispectrum, which we convert to a late-time
galaxy correlator prediction (through a highly non-trivial calculation) and
constrain using the observed data. We find no evidence for inflationary
parity-violation (with each of the $18$ models having significances below
$2.4\sigma$), and place the first constraints on the relevant coupling
strengths, at a level comparable with the theoretical perturbativity bounds.
This is also the first time Cosmological Collider signatures have directly been
searched for in observational data. We further show that possible secondary
parity-violating signatures in galaxy clustering can be systematically
described within the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure. We argue
that these late-time contributions are subdominant compared to the primordial
parity-odd signal for a vast region of parameter space. In summary, the results
of this paper disfavor the notion that the recent hints of parity-violation
observed in the distribution of galaxies are due to new physics.
