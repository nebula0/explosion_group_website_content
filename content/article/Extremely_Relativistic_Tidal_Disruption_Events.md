 Extreme tidal disruption events (eTDEs), which occur when a star passes very
close to a supermassive black hole, may provide a way to observe a long-sought
general relativistic effect: orbits that wind several times around a black hole
and then leave. Through general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we show
that such eTDEs are easily distinguished from most tidal disruptions, in which
stars come close, but not so close, to the black hole. Following the stellar
orbit, the debris in eTDEs is initially distributed in a crescent that quickly
turns into tight spirals, from which some mass later falls back toward the
black hole, while the remainder is ejected. Internal shocks within the
infalling debris power the observed emission. The resulting light-curve rises
rapidly to roughly the Eddington luminosity, maintains this level for between a
few weeks and a year (depending on both the stellar mass and the black hole
mass), and then drops. Most of its power is in thermal X-rays at a temperature
$\sim 10^{6}$ K ($\sim 100$ eV). The debris evolution and observational
features of eTDEs are qualitatively different from ordinary TDEs, making eTDEs
a new type of TDE. Although eTDEs are relatively rare for lower-mass black
holes, most tidal disruptions around higher-mass black holes are extreme. Their
detection offers a view of an exotic relativistic phenomenon previously
inaccessible.
