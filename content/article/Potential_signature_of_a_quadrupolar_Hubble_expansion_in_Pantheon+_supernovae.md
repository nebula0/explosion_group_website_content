 The assumption of isotropy -- that the Universe looks the same in all
directions on large scales -- is fundamental to the standard cosmological
model. This model forms the building blocks of essentially all of our
cosmological knowledge to date. It is therefore critical to empirically test in
which regimes its core assumptions hold. Anisotropies in the cosmic expansion
are expected on small scales due to nonlinear structures in the late Universe,
however, the extent to which these anisotropies might impact our low-redshift
observations remains to be fully tested. In this paper, we use fully general
relativistic simulations to calculate the expected local anisotropic expansion
and identify the dominant multipoles in cosmological parameters to be the
quadrupole in the Hubble parameter and the dipole in the deceleration
parameter. We constrain these multipoles simultaneously in the new Pantheon+
supernova compilation. The fiducial analysis is done in the rest frame of the
CMB with peculiar velocity corrections. Under the fiducial range of redshifts
in the Hubble flow sample, we find a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from isotropy. We
constrain the eigenvalues of the quadrupole in the Hubble parameter to be
$\lambda_1 =0.021\pm{ 0.011}$ and $ {\lambda_2= 3.15\times 10^{-5}}\pm 0.012$
and place a $1\sigma$ upper limit on its amplitude of $2.88\%$. We find no
significant dipole in the deceleration parameter, finding constraints of
$q_{\rm dip} = 4.5^{+1.9}_{-5.4}$. However, in the rest frame of the CMB
without corrections, we find $ q_{ \rm dip} = 9.6^{+4.0}_{-6.9}$, a $>2\sigma$
positive amplitude. We also investigate the impact of these anisotropies on the
Hubble tension. We find a maximal shift of $0.30$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the
monopole of the Hubble parameter and conclude that local anisotropies are
unlikely to fully explain the observed tension.
