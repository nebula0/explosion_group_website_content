 In this paper intergalatic electromagnetic cascades are used as a probe of
cosmic ray sources. This is achieved as follows. In extragalactic space cosmic
rays initiate electromagnetic cascades in which gamma-ray and neutrino emission
arises. We used the joint analysis of cosmic ray data, along with extragalactic
gamma-ray and neutrino emission, to study particle acceleration in the vicinity
of supermassive black holes. Particle injection spectra depend on processes of
particle acceleration, and here we discuss models with various injection
spectra. The computation of the propagation of cosmic rays in space were
performed using the publicly avaliable TransportCR code. It was found that a
new subclass of sources might exist that does not contribute to the particle
flux on Earth, instead to gamma-ray and neutrino emissions arising in
electromagnetic cascades. In addition, the upper limit of the relative number
of 'exotic' supermassive black holes surrounded by a superstrong magnetic field
is derived.
