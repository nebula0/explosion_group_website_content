 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in all types of
galaxies from dwarfs to massive galaxies. Recent studies show that while
low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies ($M_\text{gal} < 10^{9} M_\odot$) form
predominantly out of the merger of globular clusters (GCs), high-mass NSCs in
massive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central enriched
star formation. So far, these results of a transition in the dominant NSC
formation channel have been based on studies of early-type galaxies and massive
late-type galaxies. Here, we present the first spectroscopic analysis of a
sample of nine nucleated late-type dwarf galaxies with the aim of identifying
the dominant NSC formation pathway. We use integral-field spectroscopy data
obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument to
analyse the ages, metallicities, star formation histories, and star formation
rates of the NSCs and their surroundings. Our sample includes galaxies with
stellar masses $M_\text{gal} = 10^7 - 10^9 M_\odot$ and NSC masses
$M_\text{NSC} = 6 \times 10^4 - 6 \times 10^{6} M_\odot$. Although all NSC
spectra show emission lines, this emission is not always connected to star
formation within the NSC, but rather to other regions along the line-of-sight.
The NSC star formation histories reveal that metal-poor and old populations
dominate the stellar populations in five NSCs, possibly stemming from the
inspiral of GCs. The NSCs of the most massive galaxies in our sample show
significant contributions from young and enriched populations that indicate
additional mass growth through central star formation. Our results support
previous findings of a transition in the dominant NSC formation channel with
galaxy mass, showing that the NSCs in low-mass galaxies predominantly grow
through the inspiral of GCs, while central star formation can contribute to NSC
growth in more massive galaxies.
