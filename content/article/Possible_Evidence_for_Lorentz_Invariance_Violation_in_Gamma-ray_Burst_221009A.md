 The preliminary detections of the gamma-ray burst 221009A up to 18 TeV by
LHAASO and up to 251 TeV by Carpet 2 have been reported through Astronomer's
Telegrams and Gamma-ray Coordination Network circulars. Since this burst is at
redshift $z=0.15$, these photons may at first seem to have a low probability to
avoid pair production off of background radiation fields and survive to reach
detectors on Earth. By extrapolating the reported $0.1-1.0$\ GeV LAT spectrum
from this burst to higher energies and using this to limit the intrinsic
spectrum of the burst, we show that the survival of the 18 TeV photon detected
by LHAASO is not unlikely with many recent extragalactic background light
models, although the detection of a 251 TeV event is still very unlikely. This
can be resolved if Lorentz invariance is violated at an energy scale $E_{\rm
QG}> 49 E_{\rm Planck}$ in the linear ($n=1$) case, and $E_{\rm QG}>
10^{-6}E_{\rm Planck}$ in the quadratic ($n=2$) case (95% confidence limits),
where $E_{\rm Planck}$ is the Planck energy. This could potentially be the
first evidence for subluminal Lorentz invariance violation.
