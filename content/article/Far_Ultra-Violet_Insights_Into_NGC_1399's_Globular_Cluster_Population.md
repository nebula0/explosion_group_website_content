 We investigate archival Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC F140LP observations of
NGC~1399 to search for evidence of multiple stellar populations in
extragalactic globular clusters. Enhanced FUV populations are thought to be
indicators of He-enhanced second generation populations in globular clusters,
specifically extreme/blue horizontal branch stars. Out of 149 globular clusters
in the field of view, 58 have far ultraviolet (FUV) counterparts with
magnitudes brighter than 28.5. Six of these FUV-deteced globular clusters are
also detected in X-rays, including one ultraluminous X-ray source ($L_X >
10^{39}$ erg/s). While optically bright clusters corresponded to brighter FUV
counterparts, we observe FUV emission from both metal-rich and metal-poor
clusters, which implies that the FUV excess is not dependent on optical colour.
We also find no evidence that the cluster size influences the FUV emission. The
clusters with X-ray emission are not unusually FUV bright, which suggests that
even the ultraluminous X-ray source does not provide significant FUV
contributions. NGC 1399 is only the fourth galaxy to have its globular cluster
system probed for evidence of FUV-enhanced populations, and we compare these
clusters to previous studies of the Milky Way, M31, M87, and the brightest
cluster in M81. These sources indicate that many globular clusters likely host
extreme HB stars and/or second generation stars, and highlight the need for
more complete FUV observations of extragalactic globular cluster systems.
