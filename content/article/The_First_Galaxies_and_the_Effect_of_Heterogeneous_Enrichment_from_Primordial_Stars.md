 We incorporate new scale-intelligent models of metal-enriched star formation
(\starss) with surrogate models of primordial stellar feedback (\starnet) into
the astrophysics simulation code \enzo to analyze the impact of heterogeneous
metal enrichment on the first galaxies. Our study includes the earliest
generations of stars and the protogalaxies ($10^6 \lesssim M_v/M_\odot \lesssim
10^8$) containing them. We compare results obtained with the new methods to two
common paradigms of metallicity initial conditions in simulations: ignoring the
metallicity initial condition and assuming a uniform metallicity floor. We find
that ignoring metallicity requirements for enriched star formation results in a
redshift-dependent excess in stellar mass created and compounding errors
consisting of stars forming in pristine gas. We find that using a metallicity
floor causes an early underproduction of stars before $z=21$ that reverses to
overproduction by $z=18$. At the final redshift, $z=14.95$, there is $\sim
20\%$ excess stellar mass with 8.6\% increased protogalaxy count. Heterogeneous
metallicity initial conditions greatly increase the range of halo observables,
e.g., stellar metallicity, stellar mass, and luminosity. The increased range
leads to better agreement with observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies when
compared to metallicity-floor simulations. \starnet generates protogalaxies
with low stellar mass, $M_* \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$, so may also serve to model
low-luminosity protogalaxies more effectively than a metallicity floor
criterion at similar spatial and mass resolution.
