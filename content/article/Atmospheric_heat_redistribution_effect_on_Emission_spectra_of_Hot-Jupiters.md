 Hot Jupiters are the most studied and easily detectable exoplanets for
transit observations.However, the correlation between the atmospheric flow and
the emission spectra of such planets is still not understood. Due to huge
day-night temperature contrast in hot Jupiter, the thermal redistribution
through atmospheric circulation has a significant impact on the vertical
temperature-pressure structure and on the emission spectra. In the present
work, we aim to study the variation of the temperature-pressure profiles and
the emission spectra of such planets due to different amounts of atmospheric
heat redistribution. For this purpose, we first derive an analytical relation
between the heat redistribution parameter f and the emitted flux from the
uppermost atmospheric layers of hot Jupiter. We adopt the three possible values
of f under isotropic approximation as 1/4, 1/2, and 2/3 for
full-redistribution, semi-redistribution and no-redistribution cases
respectively and calculate the corresponding temperature-pressure profiles and
the emission spectra. Next, we model the emission spectra for different values
of f by numerically solving the radiative transfer equations using the discrete
space theory formalism. We demonstrate that the atmospheric
temperature-pressure profiles and the emission spectra both are susceptible to
the values of the heat redistribution function. A reduction in the heat
redistribution yields a thermal inversion in the temperature-pressure profiles
and hence increases the amount of emission flux. Finally, we revisits the hot
Jupiter XO-1b temperature-pressure profile degeneracy case and show that a
non-inversion temperature-pressure profile best explains this observed
planetary dayside emission spectra.
