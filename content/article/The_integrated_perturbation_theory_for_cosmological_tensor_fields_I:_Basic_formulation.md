 In order to extract maximal information about cosmology from the large-scale
structure of the Universe, one needs to use every bit of signals that can be
observed. Beyond the spatial distributions of astronomical objects, the spatial
correlations of tensor fields, such as galaxy spins and shapes, are ones of
promising sources that we can access in the era of large surveys in near
future. The perturbation theory is a powerful tool to analytically describe the
behaviors and evolutions of correlation statistics for a given cosmology. In
this paper, we formulate a nonlinear perturbation theory of tensor fields in
general, based on the existing formulation of integrated perturbation theory
for the scalar-valued bias, generalizing it to include the tensor-valued bias.
To take advantage of rotational symmetry, the formalism is constructed on the
basis of irreducible decomposition of tensors, identifying physical variables
which are invariant under the rotation of the coordinates system. Describing
fundamental formulations and calculation techniques, this paper is expected to
serve as a useful reference for future applications of perturbation theory to
tensor fields in general.
