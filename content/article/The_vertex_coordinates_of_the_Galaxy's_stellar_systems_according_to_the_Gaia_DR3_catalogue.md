 We present the results of determining the coordinates of the vertices of
various stellar systems, the centroids of which are located in the Galactic
plane. To do this, the positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and radial
velocities of red giants and subgiants contained in the Gaia DR3 catalogue have
been used. When determining the components of the deformation velocity tensors
in local coordinate systems, we found the coordinates of the vertices of the
stellar systems under study. It turned out that there is a complex dependence
of vertex deviations lxy in Galactocentric cylindrical (R,\theta) and Galactic
rectangular (X,Y) coordinates. Based on the approach proposed in this paper,
heliocentric distances to vertices have been determined for the first time. The
results obtained show that in addition to the fact that the spherical
coordinates of the Galactic center and the vertices of stellar systems do not
coincide, their heliocentric distances do not coincide as well. This indicates
that there are structures in the Galaxy that noticeably affect its axisymmetry.
