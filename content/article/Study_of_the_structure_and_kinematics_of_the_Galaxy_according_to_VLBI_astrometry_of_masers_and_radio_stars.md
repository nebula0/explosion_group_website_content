 In recent years, radio interferometric observations have achieved high
accuracy in determining the absolute values of trigonometric parallaxes and
proper motions of maser radiation sources and radio stars. The error in
determining the trigonometric parallaxes of these objects averages about 10
microarcseconds, which allows us to confidently study the geometric and
kinematic properties of the distribution of stars located at great distances
from the Sun, up to the center of the Galaxy. This article provides an overview
of the main results of studying the structure and kinematics of the Galaxy,
which were obtained by various scientific teams using VLBI observations of
masers and radio stars. The main attention is paid to the results of studying
the Galaxy obtained by the authors of this work.
