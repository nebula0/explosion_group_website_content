 We study the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) for matter
density averaged over spherical cells. The leading part to the PDF is defined
by the dynamics of the spherical collapse whereas the next-to-leading part
comes from the integration over fluctuations around the saddle-point solution.
The latter calculation receives sizable contributions from unphysical short
modes and must be renormalized. We propose a new approach to renormalization by
modeling the effective stress-energy tensor for short perturbations. The model
contains three free parameters related to the counterterms in the one-loop
matter power spectrum and bispectrum, as well as their redshift dependence.
This relation can be used to impose priors in fitting the model to the PDF
data. We confront the model with the results of high-resolution N-body
simulations and find excellent agreement for cell radii $r_*\geq 10\,{\rm
Mpc}/h$ at all redshifts up to $z=0$. Discrepancies at a few per cent level are
detected at low redshifts for $r_*\leq 10\,{\rm Mpc}/h$ and are associated with
two-loop corrections to the model.
