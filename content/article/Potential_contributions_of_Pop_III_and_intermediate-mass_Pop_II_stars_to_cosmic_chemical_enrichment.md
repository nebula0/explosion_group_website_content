 We propose a semi-analytic model that is developed to understand the
cosmological evolution of the mean metallicity in the Universe. In particular,
we study the contributions of Population III (Pop III) and Population II (Pop
II) stars to the production of $\mathrm{Fe,~Si,~Zn, ~Ni,~P, ~Mg, ~Al, ~S, ~C,
~N}$, and $\mathrm{~O}$. We aim to quantify the roles of two different models
in the chemical enrichment of the Universe. The first model (A) considers both
stars with Pop III and Pop II yields. For the second model (B), the yields
involved are only for Pop II stars. We start by describing the cosmic star
formation rate (CSFR) through an adaptation of a scenario developed within the
hierarchical scenario of structure formation with a Press-Schechter-like
formalism. We adapt the formalism to implement the CSFR to the standard
chemical evolution scenario to investigate the course of chemical evolution on
a cosmological basis. Calculations start at redshift $z\sim 20$, and we compare
the results of our two models with data from damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems
(DLAs), and globular clusters (GCs). Our main results find that metal
production in the Universe occurred very early, quickly increasing with the
formation of the first stars. When comparing results for [Fe/H] with
observations from GCs, yields of Pop II stars are not enough to explain the
observed chemical abundances, requiring stars with physical properties similar
those expected from Pop III stars. Our semi-analytic model can deliver
consistent results for the evolution of cosmic metallicities. Our results show
that the chemical enrichment in the early Universe is rapid, and at redshift
$\sim 12.5$, the metallicity reaches $10^{-4}\, Z_{\odot}$ for the model that
includes Pop III stars. In addition, we explore values for the initial mass
function (IMF) within the range $[0.85, 1.85]$.
