 The spin-down limit of the continuous gravitational wave strain (assuming
pulsars as triaxial rotators) depends upon the value of the intrinsic spin
frequency derivative of the pulsar, among other parameters. In order to get
more accurate intrinsic spin frequency derivative values, dynamical effects
contributing to the measured spin frequency derivative values must be estimated
via more realistic approaches. In this work, we calculate improved values of
the spin-down limit of the gravitational wave strain (assuming pulsars as
triaxial rotators) for a set of 237 pulsars for which a targeted search for
continuous gravitational waves was carried out by the LVK Collaboration,
recently. We use `GalDynPsr', a python-based public package, to calculate more
realistic values of intrinsic spin frequency derivatives, and consequently, we
get, more realistic values of the spin-down limit. For 136 pulsars, we obtain a
higher value of the spin-down limit as compared to recently estimated values by
the LVK Collaboration.
