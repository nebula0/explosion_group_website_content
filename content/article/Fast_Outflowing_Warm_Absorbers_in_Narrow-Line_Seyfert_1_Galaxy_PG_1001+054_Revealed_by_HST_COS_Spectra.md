 Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) Galaxies are an important type of active
galactic nucleus (AGN), generally expected to be accreting at high Eddington
rate. The properties of their outflows and importance of AGN feedback remain
intriguing. We report on the discovery of fast outflowing warm absorbers (WAs)
in the NLS1 PG 1001+054, with velocities in the range of 7000 to 9000
kilometers per second. They are identified with blueshifted Lyman alpha, N v
and Si iv lines in the high resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectra taken with the
Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We
perform photoionization modeling using XSTAR with three WAs. The derived
physical properties are typical of WAs in terms of ionization and column
density, whereas the outflow velocities are significantly higher. The estimated
location of these WAs ranges from 1 to 73 parsecs away from the AGN. Together
with previous detection of high ionization absorber in the X-ray for PG
1001+054, we suggest that the fast outflowing UV absorber is probably a part of
a multiphase outflow. Such structure is likely produced by the outflow launched
from AGN at accretion disk scale, which shocks the ambient ISM producing
stratified absorbers. Assuming contribution from the three WAs at tens of
parsecs, the estimated ratio between the kinetic power of the outflow and AGN
Eddington luminosity could reach 1.7 percent, raising the possibility of
sufficient influence on the host galaxy when compared to some theoretical
models for efficient AGN feedback.
