 Theory predicts that the temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas
($\sim$10$^{6}$ K) detected from planetary nebulae (PNe) is a consequence of
mixing or thermal conduction when in contact with the ionized outer rim
($\sim$10$^{4}$ K). Gas at intermediate temperatures ($\sim$10$^{5}$ K) can be
used to study the physics of the production of X-ray-emitting gas, via C IV, N
V and O VI ions. Here we model the stellar atmosphere of the CSPN of NGC 1501
to demonstrate that even this hot H-deficient [WO4]-type star cannot produce
these emission lines by photoionization. We use the detection of the C IV lines
to assess the physical properties of the mixing region in this PNe in
comparison with its X-ray-emitting gas, rendering NGC 1501 only the second PNe
with such characterization. We extend our predictions to the hottest [WO1] and
cooler [WC5] spectral types and demonstrate that most energetic photons are
absorbed in the dense winds of [WR] CSPN and highly ionized species can be used
to study the physics behind the production of hot bubbles in PNe. We found that
the UV observations of NGC 2452, NGC 6751 and NGC 6905 are consistent with the
presence mixing layers and hot bubbles, providing excellent candidates for
future X-ray observations.
