 We present a new definition of cosmic void and a publicly available code with
the algorithm that implements it. In this void finder, underdense regions are
defined as free-form objects, called popcorn voids, made from the union of
spheres of maximum volume with a given joint integrated underdensity contrast.
This provides, for the first time, a definition of a void in the matter field
whose abundance can be faithfully reproduced by excursion set theory, in
particular using the Vdn model without any adjustment or cleaning process. We
also analysed the abundance of voids in biased tracer samples in redshift
space. We show how the void abundance can be used to measure the geometric
distortions due to the assumed fiducial cosmology, in a proof similar to an
Alcock-Paczy\'nski test. Using the formalism derived from previous works, we
show how to correct the abundance of popcorn voids for redshift-space
distortions. Using this treatment, in combination with the excursion set
theory, we demonstrate the feasibility of void abundance measurements as
cosmological probes. We obtain unbiased estimates of the target parameters,
albeit with large degeneracies in the parameter space. Therefore, we conclude
that the proposed test in combination with other cosmological probes has
potential to improve current cosmological parameter constraints.
