 A significant number of stellar binary black hole (sBBH) mergers may be
lensed and detected by the third generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors.
Their lensed host galaxies may be detectable, which thus helps to accurately
localize these sources and provide a new approach to study the origin of sBBHs.
In this paper, we investigate the detectability of the lensed host galaxies for
the lensed sBBH mergers. We find that the detection fraction of the host
galaxies to the lensed GW events can be significantly different for a survey
with a given limiting magnitude if sBBHs are produced by different mechanisms,
such as the evolution of massive binary stars, the dynamical interactions in
dense star clusters, and that assisted by active galactic nuclei or massive
black holes. Furthermore, we illustrate that the statistical spatial
distribution of those lensed sBBHs in its hosts resulting from different sBBH
formation channels can be different from each other. Therefore, with the third
generation GW detectors and future large scale galaxy surveys, it is possible
to independently constrain the sBBH origin via the detection fraction of those
lensed events with identifiable lensing host signatures and/or even constrain
the contribution fractions from different sBBH formation mechanisms
