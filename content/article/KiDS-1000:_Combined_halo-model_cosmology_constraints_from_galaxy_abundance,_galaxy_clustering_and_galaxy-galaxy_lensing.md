 We present constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model through a
joint analysis of galaxy abundance, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing
observables with the Kilo-Degree Survey. Our theoretical model combines a
flexible conditional stellar mass function, to describe the galaxy-halo
connection, with a cosmological N-body simulation-calibrated halo model to
describe the non-linear matter field. Our magnitude-limited bright galaxy
sample combines 9-band optical-to-near-infrared photometry with an extensive
and complete spectroscopic training sample to provide accurate redshift and
stellar mass estimates. Our faint galaxy sample provides a background of
accurately calibrated lensing measurements. We constrain the structure growth
parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3} =
0.773^{+0.028}_{-0.030}$, and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}
= 0.290^{+0.021}_{-0.017}$. The galaxy-halo connection model adopted in the
work is shown to be in agreement with previous studies. Our constraints on
cosmological parameters are comparable to, and consistent with, joint
'$3\times2{\mathrm{pt}}$' clustering-lensing analyses that additionally include
a cosmic shear observable. This analysis therefore brings attention to the
significant constraining power in the often-excluded non-linear scales for
galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing observables. By adopting a
theoretical model that accounts for non-linear halo bias, halo exclusion,
scale-dependent galaxy bias and the impact of baryon feedback, this work
demonstrates the potential and a way forward to include non-linear scales in
cosmological analyses.
