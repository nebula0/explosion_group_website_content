 Stellar bars are key drivers of secular evolution in galaxies and can be
effectively studied using rest-frame near-infrared (NIR) images, which trace
the underlying stellar mass and are less impacted by dust and star formation
than rest-frame UV or optical images. We leverage the power of James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) CEERS NIRCam images to present the first quantitative
identification and characterization of stellar bars at $z>1$ based on
rest-frame NIR F444W images of high resolution ($\sim$1.3 kpc at $z\sim$1-3).
We identify stellar bars in these images using quantitative criteria based on
ellipse fits. For this pilot study, we present six examples of robustly
identified bars at $z>1$ with spectroscopic redshifts, including the two
highest redshift bars at $z\sim$2.136 and 2.312 quantitatively identified and
characterized to date. The stellar bars at $z\sim$1.1-2.3 presented in our
study have projected semi-major axes of 2.9-4.3 kpc and projected ellipticities
of 0.41-0.53 in the rest-frame NIR. The barred host galaxies have stellar
masses $\sim 1 \times 10^{10}$ to $2 \times 10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, star
formation rates of $\sim$ 21-295 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and several have
potential nearby companions. Our finding of bars at $z\sim$1.1-2.3 demonstrates
the early onset of such instabilities and supports simulations where bars form
early in massive dynamically cold disks. It also suggests that if these bars at
lookback times of 8-10 Gyr survive out to present epochs, bar-driven secular
processes may operate over a long time and have a significant impact on some
galaxies by $z \sim$0.
