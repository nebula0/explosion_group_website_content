 We report on the discovery of two new molecules, HCCCHCCC and HCCCCS, towards
the starless core TMC-1 in the Taurus region from the QUIJOTE line survey in
the 31.1-50.2 GHz frequency range. We identify a total of twenty-nine lines of
HCCCHCCC and six rotational transitions of HCCCCS. The rotational quantum
numbers range from Ju=10 up to 15 and Ka <=2 for HCCCHCCC and Ju=21/2 up to
31/2 for HCCCCS. We derived a column density for HCCCHCCC of
N=(1.3+/-0.2)x10^11 cm-2 with a rotational temperature of 6+/-1 K, while for
HCCCCS we derived N=(9.5+/-0.8)x10^10 cm-2 and Trot =10+/-1 K. The abundance of
HCCCHCCC is higher than that of its recently discovered isomer, l-H2C6. If we
compare HCCCCS with its related molecules, HCS and HCCS, we obtain abundance
ratios HCS/HCCCCS=58 and HCCS/HCCCCS=7.2. We investigated the formation of
these two molecules using chemical modelling calculations. The observed
abundances can be accounted for by assuming standard gas-phase formation routes
involving neutral-neutral reactions and ion-neutral reactions.
