 After hydrogen and helium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen - hereinafter, the
CNO elements - are the most abundant species in the universe. They are observed
in all kinds of astrophysical environments, from the smallest to the largest
scales, and are at the basis of all known forms of life, hence, the
constituents of any biomarker. As such, their study proves crucial in several
areas of contemporary astrophysics, extending to astrobiology. In this review,
I will summarize current knowledge about CNO element evolution in galaxies,
starting from our home, the Milky Way. After a brief recap of CNO synthesis in
stars, I will present the comparison between chemical evolution model
predictions and observations of CNO isotopic abundances and abundance ratios in
stars and in gaseous matter. Such a comparison permits to constrain the modes
and time scales of the assembly of galaxies and their stellar populations, as
well as stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis theories. I will stress that
chemical evolution models must be carefully calibrated against the wealth of
abundance data available for the Milky Way before they can be applied to the
interpretation of observational datasets for other systems. In this vein, I
will also discuss the usefulness of some key CNO isotopic ratios as probes of
the prevailing, galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function in galaxies where
more direct estimates from starlight are unfeasible.
