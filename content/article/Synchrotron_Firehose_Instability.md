 We demonstrate using linear theory and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations
that a synchrotron-cooling collisionless plasma acquires pressure anisotropy
and, if the plasma beta is sufficiently high, becomes unstable to the firehose
instability, in a process that we dub the synchrotron firehose instability
(SFHI). The SFHI channels free energy from the pressure anisotropy of the
radiating, relativistic electrons (and/or positrons) into small-amplitude,
kinetic-scale magnetic-field fluctuations, which pitch-angle scatter the
particles and bring the plasma to a near-thermal state of marginal instability.
The PIC simulations reveal a nonlinear cyclic evolution of firehose bursts
interspersed by periods of stable cooling. We compare the SFHI for
electron-positron and electron-ion plasmas. As a byproduct of the growing
electron-firehose magnetic field fluctuations, magnetized ions gain a pressure
anisotropy opposite to that of the electrons. If these ions are
relativistically hot, we find that they also experience cooling due to
collisionless thermal coupling with the electrons, which we argue is mediated
by a secondary ion-cyclotron instability. We suggest that the SFHI may be
activated in a number of astrophysical scenarios, such as within ejecta from
black-hole accretion flows and relativistic jets, where the redistribution of
energetic electrons from low to high pitch angles may cause transient bursts of
radiation.
