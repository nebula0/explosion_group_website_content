 Recent theoretical studies predict that the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
around low-redshift, $\sim L_{\ast}$ galaxies could have substantial nonthermal
pressure support in the form of cosmic rays. However, these predictions are
sensitive to the specific model of cosmic-ray transport employed, which is
theoretically and observationally underconstrained. In this work, we propose a
novel observational constraint for calculating the lower limit of the
radially-averaged, effective cosmic-ray transport rate, $\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm
eff}$. Under a wide range of assumptions (regardless of whether the cosmic-ray
pressure is important or not in the CGM), we demonstrate a well-defined
relationship between $\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}$ and three observable galaxy
properties: the total hydrogen column density, the average star formation rate,
and the gas circular velocity. We use a suite of FIRE-2 galaxy simulations with
a variety of cosmic-ray transport physics to demonstrate that our analytic
model of $\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}$ is a robust lower limit of the true
cosmic-ray transport rate. We then apply our new model to calculate
$\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}$ for galaxies in the COS-Halos sample, and confirm
this already reveals strong evidence for an effective transport rate which
rises rapidly away from the interstellar medium to values $\kappa_{\rm
min}^{\rm eff} \gtrsim 10^{30-31}\,{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ (corresponding to
anisotropic streaming velocities of $v^{\rm stream}_{\rm eff} \gtrsim
1000\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$) in the diffuse CGM, at impact parameters larger
than $50-100$ kpc. We discuss how future observations can provide qualitatively
new constraints in our understanding of cosmic rays in the CGM and
intergalactic medium.
