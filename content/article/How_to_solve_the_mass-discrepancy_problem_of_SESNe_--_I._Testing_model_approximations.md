 Here, we present a systematic study of 59 stripped-envelope supernovae
(SESNe) (including Type IIb, Ib, Ic, and transitional events) to map a possible
reason for the so-called mass-discrepancy problem. In this scenario, we assume
the tension between the estimated ejected masses from early- and late-time
light curves (LC) is due to approximations generally used in analytical models.
First, we examine the assumption that the R-band light curve is indeed a good
approximation of the bolometric light curve. Next, we test the generally used
assumption that rise-time to maximum brightness is equal to the effective
diffusion time-scale that can be used to derive the ejecta mass from the early
LC. In addition, we analyze the effect of gamma-ray and positron-leakage, which
play an important role in forming the shape of the tails of SESNe, and also can
be crucial to gaining the ejecta masses from the late-time LC data. Finally, we
consider the effect of the different definitions of velocity that are needed
for the ejecta mass calculations.
