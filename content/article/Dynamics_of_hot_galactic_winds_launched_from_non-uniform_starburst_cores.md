 The galactic wind model of Chevalier1985 (CC85) assumes $\textit{uniform}$
energy and mass-injection within the starburst galaxy nucleus. However, the
structure of nuclear star clusters, bulges, and star-forming knots are
inherently non-uniform. We generalize to cases with non-uniform energy/mass
injection that scale as $r^{-\Delta}$ within the starburst volume $R$,
providing solutions for $\Delta = 0$, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2. In marked contrast
with the CC85 model ($\Delta=0$), which predicts zero velocity at the center,
for a singular isothermal sphere profile ($\Delta=2$), we find that the flow
maintains a $\textit{constant}$ Mach number of $\mathcal{M}=\sqrt{3/5} \simeq
0.77$ throughout the volume. The fast interior flow can be as $v_{r < R} =
(\dot{E}_T/3\dot{M}_T)^{1/2} \simeq 0.41 \, v_\infty$, where $v_\infty$ is the
asymptotic velocity, and $\dot{E}_T$ and $\dot{M}_T$ are the total energy and
mass injection rates. For $v_\infty \simeq 2000 \, \mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$,
$v_{r<R} \simeq 820 \, \mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$ throughout the wind-driving
region. The temperature and density profiles of the non-uniform models may be
important for interpreting spatially-resolved maps of starburst nuclei. We
compute velocity resolved spectra to contrast the CC85 and $\Delta=2$ models.
Next generation X-ray space telescopes such as XRISM may assess these kinematic
predictions.
