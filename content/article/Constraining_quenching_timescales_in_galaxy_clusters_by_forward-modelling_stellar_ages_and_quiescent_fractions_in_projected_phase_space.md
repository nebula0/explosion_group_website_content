 We forward-model mass-weighted ages (MWAs) and quiescent fractions in
projected phase space (PPS), using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to
jointly constrain an infall quenching model for galaxies in
$\log(M_{\mathrm{vir}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})>14$ galaxy clusters at $z\sim 0$. We
find the average deviation in MWA from the MWA-$M_\star$ relation depends on
position in PPS, with a maximum difference between the inner cluster and
infalling interloper galaxies of $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our model employs infall
information from N-body simulations and stochastic star-formation histories
from the UniverseMachine model. We find total quenching times of
$t_\mathrm{Q}=3.7\pm 0.4$ Gyr and $t_\mathrm{Q}=4.0\pm 0.2$ Gyr after first
pericentre, for $9<\log(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<10$ and
$10<\log(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<10.5$ galaxies, respectively. By using
MWAs, we break the degeneracy in time of quenching onset and timescale of star
formation rate (SFR) decline. We find that time of quenching onset relative to
pericentre is $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=3.5^{+0.6}_{-0.9}$ Gyr and
$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=-0.3^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ Gyr for our lower and higher stellar
mass bins, respectively, and exponential SFR suppression timescales are
$\tau_{\mathrm{env}}\leq 1.0$ Gyr and $\tau_{\mathrm{env}}\sim 2.3$ Gyr for our
lower and higher stellar mass bins, respectively. Stochastic star formation
histories remove the need for rapid infall quenching to maintain the bimodality
in the SFR of cluster galaxies; the depth of the green valley prefers quenching
onsets close to first pericentre and a longer quenching envelope, in slight
tension with the MWA-driven results. Taken together these results suggest that
quenching begins close to, or just after pericentre, but the timescale for
quenching to be fully complete is much longer and therefore ram-pressure
stripping is not complete on first pericentric passage.
