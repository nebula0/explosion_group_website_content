 Planets can carve gaps in the surface density of protoplanetary discs. The
formation of these gaps can reduce the corotation torques acting on the
planets. In addition, gaps can halt the accretion of solids onto the planets as
dust and pebbles can be trapped at the edge of the gap. This accumulation of
dust could explain the origin of the ring-like dust structures observed using
high-resolution interferometry. In this work we provide an empirical scaling
relation for the depth of the gap cleared by a planet on an eccentric orbit as
a function of the planet-to-star mass ratio $q$, the disc aspect ratio $h$,
Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and planetary eccentricity $e$.
We construct the scaling relation using a heuristic approach: we calibrate a
toy model based on the impulse approximation with 2D hydrodynamical
simulations. The scaling reproduces the gap depth for moderate eccentricities
($e\leq 4h$) and when the surface density contrast outside and inside the gap
is $\leq 10^{2}$. Our framework can be used as the basis of more sophisticated
models aiming to predict the radial gap profile for eccentric planets.
