 In the study of radiation mechanisms of AGNs' jets, hadronuclear (pp)
interactions are commonly neglected, because the number density of cold protons
in the jet is considered insufficient. Very recently, our previous work proves
that pp interactions in the low TeV luminosity AGNs, which have potential to
generate detectable very-high-energy (VHE) emission, could be important. Based
on this, the one-zone pp model is employed to study low-state
quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions of a sample of low TeV
luminosity AGNs in this work. Our modeling results show that the gamma-ray
generated in pp interactions can explain the observed TeV spectra and has
contribution to higher energy band that could be detected by the Large High
Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In the sample, we suggest that M 87,
Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 are the most likely objects to be detected by LHAASO in the
near future. Other possible origins of VHE emission are also briefly discussed.
