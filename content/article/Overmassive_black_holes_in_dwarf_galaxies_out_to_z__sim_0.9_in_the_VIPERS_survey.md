 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to originate from early Universe
seed black holes of mass $M_\mathrm{BH} \sim 10^2$-10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ and grown
through cosmic time. Such seeds could be powering the active galactic nuclei
(AGN) found in today's dwarf galaxies. However, probing a connection between
the early seeds and local SMBHs has not yet been observationally possible.
Massive black holes hosted in dwarf galaxies at intermediate redshifts, on the
other hand, may represent the evolved counterparts of the seeds formed at very
early times. We present a sample of seven broad-line AGN in dwarf galaxies with
a spectroscopic redshift ranging from z=0.35 to z=0.93. The sources are drawn
from the VIPERS survey as having a stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{*}$) LMC-like
derived from spectral energy distribution fitting and they are all star-forming
galaxies. Six of these sources are also X-ray AGN. The AGN are powered by SMBHs
of $>10^7$ M$_{\odot}$, more massive than expected from the
$M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{*}$ scaling relation of AGN. Based on
semi-analytical simulations, we find that these objects are likely overmassive
with respect to their hosts since early times (z$>$4), independently of whether
they formed as heavy ($\rm \sim 10^5$ M$_\odot$) or light ($\rm \sim 10^2$
M$_\odot$) seed black holes. In our simulations, these objects tend to grow
faster than their host galaxies, contradicting models of synchronized growth.
The host galaxies are found to possibly evolve into massive systems by
z$\sim$0, indicating that local SMBHs in massive galaxies could originate in
dwarf galaxies hosting seed black holes at higher z.
