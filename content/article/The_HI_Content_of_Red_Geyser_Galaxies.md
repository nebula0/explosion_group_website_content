 Red geysers are a specific type of quiescent galaxy, denoted by twin jets
emerging from their galactic centers. These bisymmetric jets possibly inject
energy and heat into the surrounding material, effectively suppressing star
formation by stabilizing cool gas. In order to confirm the presence and
evolutionary consequences of these jets, this paper discusses the scaling,
stacking, and conversion of 21-cm HI flux data sourced from the HI-MaNGA survey
into HI gas-to-stellar mass (G/S) spectra. Our samples were dominated by
non-detections, or galaxies with weak HI signals, and consequently by HI upper
limits. The stacking technique discussed successfully resolved emission
features in both the red geyser G/S spectrum and the control sample G/S
spectrum. From these stacked spectra, we find that on average, red geyser
galaxies have G/S of 0.086 $\pm$ 0.011(random)+0.029(systematic), while non-red
geyser galaxies of similar stellar mass have a G/S ratio of 0.039 $\pm$
0.018(random)+0.013(systematic). Therefore, we find no statistically
significant evidence that the HI content of red geysers is different from the
general quiescent population.
