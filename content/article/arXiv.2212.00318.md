        Astrophysical S-factors at zero energy for the direct <span class="search-hit mathjax">nuclear</span> capture <span class="search-hit mathjax">reactions</span> $^{3}{\rm He}(α, γ)^{7}{\rm Be}$, $^{3}{\rm H}(α, γ)^{7}{\rm Li}$ and $^{7}{\rm Be}(p, γ)^{8}{\rm B}$ are estimated within the framework of two-body potential cluster model on the basis of extranuclear capture approximation of D. Baye and E. Brainis. The values of S(0)-factors have been calculated using two different potential models for each process, which were adjusted to the binding energies and empirical values of the asymptotical normalization coefficients from the literature. New values of S(0)-factors have been obtained.
