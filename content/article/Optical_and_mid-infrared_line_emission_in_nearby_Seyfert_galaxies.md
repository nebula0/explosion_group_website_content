 Line ratio diagnostics provide valuable clues on the source of ionizing
radiation in galaxies with intense black hole accretion and starbursting
events, like local Seyfert or galaxies at the peak of the star-formation
history. We aim at providing a reference joint optical and mid-IR analysis for
studying AGN identification via line ratios and test predictions from
photoionization models. We obtained homogenous optical spectra with the
Southern Africa Large Telescope for 42 Seyfert galaxies with IRS/Spitzer
spectroscopy and X-ray to mid-IR multi-band data available. After confirming
the power of main optical ([OIII]) and mid-IR ([NeV], [OIV], [NeIII]) emission
lines tracing AGN activity, we explore diagrams based on ratios of optical and
mid-IR lines by exploiting photoionization models of different ionizing sources
(AGN, star formation and shocks). We find that pure AGN photoionization models
reproduce well observations of Seyfert galaxies with an AGN fractional
contribution to the mid-IR (5-40 micron) emission larger than 50 per cent. For
targets with lower AGN contribution these same models do not fully reproduce
the observed mid-IR line ratios. Mid-IR ratios like [NeV]/[NeII], [OIV]/[NeII]
and [NeIII]/[NeII] show a dependence on the AGN fractional contribution to the
mid-IR unlike optical line ratios. An additional source of ionization, either
from star formation or radiative shocks, can help explain the observations in
the mid-IR. Among combinations of optical and mid-IR diagnostics in line ratio
diagrams, only those involving the [OI]/Halpha ratio are promising diagnostics
to unravel simultaneously the relative role of AGN, star formation and shocks.
A proper identification of the dominant ionizing source would require the
exploitation of analysis tools based on advanced statistical techniques as well
as spatially resolved data.
