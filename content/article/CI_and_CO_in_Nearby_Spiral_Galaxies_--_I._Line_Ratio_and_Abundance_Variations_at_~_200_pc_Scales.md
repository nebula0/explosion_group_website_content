 We present new neutral atomic carbon $[CI]$(3P1-3P0) mapping observations
within the inner ~7 kpc and ~4 kpc of the disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321 at a
spatial resolution of 190 pc and 270 pc, respectively, using the ALMA Atacama
Compact Array (ACA). We combine these with the CO(2-1) data from PHANGS-ALMA,
and literature $[CI]$ and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic
nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC1808, NGC7469), to study: a) the spatial
distributions of CI and CO emission; b) the observed line ratio RCICO =
I_$[CI]$(1-0)/I_CO(2-1) as a function of various galactic properties; and c) the
abundance ratio of $[CI/CO]$. We find excellent spatial correspondence between CI
and CO emission and nearly uniform RCICO ~0.1 across the majority of the
star-forming disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321. However, RCICO strongly varies from
~0.05 at the centre of NGC4321 to >0.2-0.5 in NGC1808's starburst centre and
NGC7469's centre with an X-ray AGN. Meanwhile, RCICO does not obviously vary
with $U$, similar to the prediction of PDR models. We also find a mildly
decreasing RCICO with an increasing metallicity over 0.7-0.85 solar
metallicity, consistent with the literature. Assuming various typical ISM
conditions representing GMCs, active star-forming regions and strong
starbursting environments, we calculate the LTE radiative transfer and estimate
the $[CI/CO]$ abundance ratio to be ~0.1 across the disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321,
similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies. However, this
abundance ratio likely has a substantial increase to ~1 and >1-5 in NGC1808's
starburst and NGC7469's strong AGN environments, respectively, in line with the
expectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region
(XDR) chemistry. Finally, we do not find a robust evidence for a generally
CO-dark, CI-bright gas in the disk areas we probed. (abbreviated)
