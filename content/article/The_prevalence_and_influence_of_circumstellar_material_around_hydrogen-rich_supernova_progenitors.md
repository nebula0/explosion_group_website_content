 Spectroscopic detection of transient narrow emission lines (flash-ionisation
features) traces the presence of circumstellar material (CSM) around massive
stars exploding as core-collapse supernovae. Transient emission lines
disappearing shortly after the SN explosion suggest that the spatial extent of
this material is compact; hence implying that the progenitor star experienced
episodes of enhanced mass loss shortly prior to explosion. The early light
curves of Type II supernovae (SNe II) are assumed to be initially powered by
shock-cooling emission. Additional luminosity may arise from interaction via
shocks with the CSM, if it is present. We performed a systematic survey of SNe
II discovered within less than two days from explosion during the first phase
of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. We gathered the early light
curves and spectra of thirty SNe II. The measured fraction of events showing
emission line evidence for CSM (>30% at 95% confidence level) indicates that
elevated mass loss is a common process occurring in massive stars. We also
measure the rise time and peak magnitude of each event. We find that SNe II
showing spectroscopic evidence for CSM interaction at early time are not
significantly brighter, nor bluer, nor more slowly rising than those who do
not. This implies that the CSM in these events is likely optically thin, and
therefore that the CSM interaction does not contribute significantly to their
early continuum emission. We also introduce for the first time a measurement of
the timescale of appearance of flash ionisation features. Most SN show flash
features for ~5 days. A rarer population of events with timescales longer than
10 days, seem to be brighter and rise longer, thus making them a potential
bridging population between regular SNe II and strongly-interacting SNe IIn.
