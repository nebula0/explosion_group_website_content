 Two recent discoveries, namely PSR J0901-4046 and GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3
(hereafter GLEAM-X J1627), have corroborated an extant population of radio-loud
periodic sources with long periods (76 s and 1091 s respectively) whose
emission can hardly be explained by rotation losses. We argue that GLEAM-X
J1627 is a highly-magnetized object consistent with a magnetar (an ultra long
period magnetar - ULPM), and demonstrate it is unlikely to be either a
magnetically or a rotationally-powered white dwarf. By studying these sources
together with previously detected objects, we find there are at least a handful
of promising candidates for Galactic ULPMs. The detections of these objects
imply a substantial number, $N \gtrsim 12800^{+19000}_{-10100}$ and $N \gtrsim
510^{+500}_{-420}$ for PSR J0901-4046 like and GLEAM-X J1627 like objects,
respectively, within our Galaxy. These source densities, as well as cooling age
limits from non-detection of thermal X-rays, Galactic offsets, timing stability
and dipole spindown limits, all imply the ULPM candidates are substantially
older than confirmed galactic magnetars and that their formation channel is a
common one. Their existence implies widespread survival of magnetar-like fields
for several Myr, distinct from the inferred behaviour in confirmed Galactic
magnetars. ULPMs may also constitute a second class of FRB progenitors which
could naturally exhibit very long periodic activity windows. Finally, we show
that existing radio campaigns are biased against detecting objects like these
and discuss strategies for future radio and X-ray surveys to identify more such
objects. We estimate that ${\cal O}(100)$ more such objects should be detected
with SKA-MID and DSA-2000.
