 Modeling the internal chemistry of molecular clouds is critical to accurately
simulating their evolution. To reduce computational expense, 3D simulations
generally restrict their chemical modeling to species with strong heating and
cooling effects. We address this by post-processing tracer particles in the
SILCC-Zoom molecular cloud simulations. Using a chemical network of 39 species
and 299 reactions (including freeze-out of CO and H$_2$O), and a novel
iterative algorithm to reconstruct a filled density grid from sparse tracer
particle data, we produce time-dependent density distributions for various
species. We focus upon the evolution of HCO$^+$, which is a critical formation
reactant of CO but is not typically modeled on-the-fly. We analyse the
evolution of the tracer particles to assess the regime in which HCO$^+$
production preferentially takes place. We find that the HCO$^+$ content of the
cold molecular gas forms in situ around $n_\textrm{HCO$^+$}\simeq10^3$-$10^4$
cm$^{-3}$, over a time-scale of approximately 1 Myr, rather than being
distributed to this density regime via turbulent mixing from deeper in the
cloud. We further show that the dominant HCO$^+$ formation pathway is dependent
on the visual extinction, with the reaction H$_3^+$ + CO contributing 90% of
the total HCO$^+$ production flux above $A_\textrm{V,3D}=3$. Using our novel
grid reconstruction algorithm, we produce the very first maps of the HCO$^+$
column density, $N$(HCO$^+$), and show that it reaches values as high as
$10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. We find that 50% of the HCO$^+$ mass is located in an
$A_\textrm{V}$-range of $\sim$10-30, and in a density range of
$10^{3.5}$-$10^{4.5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we compare our $N$(HCO$^+$) maps to
recent observations of W49A and find good agreement.
