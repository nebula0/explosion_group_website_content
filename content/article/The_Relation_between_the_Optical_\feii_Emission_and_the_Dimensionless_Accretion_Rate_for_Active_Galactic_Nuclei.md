 It was suggested that the prominent feature of the optical Fe II emission has
a connection with the accretion process in active galactic nuclei (AGN). For a
large sample of 4037 quasars ($z < 0.8$) with measured $\rm H\beta$ line
dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and 120 compiled reverberation-mapped (RM) AGN, we use $\sigma_{\rm
H\beta}$ and the extended $R_{\rm BLR}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relation to calculate
supermassive black holes masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) from the single-epoch spectra
for the SDSS subsample, and $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ from the mean spectra for the
RM subsample. We find a strong correlation between the relative optical Fe II
strength $R_{\rm Fe}$ and $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$ for the SDSS subsample with the
Spearman correlation coefficient $r_s$ of $0.727$, which is consistent with
that derived from the mean spectra for the RM subsample. The magnitude of
velocity shift of the optical Fe II emission has a strong anticorrelation with
$\dot{\mathscr{M}}$, whenever there is inflow or outflow. These strong
correlations show that the optical Fe II emission has an intimate connection
with the accretion process. Assuming that the difference of $M_{\rm BH}$ is due
to the variable virial factor $f$ for adopting $ \rm FWHM_{H\beta}$ as the
velocity tracer, we find that there is a relation between $f$ and $\rm
FWHM_{H\beta}$, $\log f=-(0.41\pm 0.002) \rm \log FWHM_{\rm H\beta}+(1.719\pm
0.009)$ for the single-epoch spectrum. The relation between $\log f$ and
$\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ is not too strong, suggesting that $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$
does not seem to depend much on the broad-line region inclination and a
constant $\sigma$-based $f$ is suitable for $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ as the
velocity tracer.
