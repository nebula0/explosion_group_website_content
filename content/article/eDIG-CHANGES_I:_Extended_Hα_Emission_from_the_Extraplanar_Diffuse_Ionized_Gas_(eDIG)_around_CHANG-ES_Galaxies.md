 The extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) represents the cool/warm ionized
gas reservoir around galaxies. We present a spatial analysis of H$\alpha$
images of 22 nearby edge-on spiral galaxies from the CHANG-ES sample (the
eDIG-CHANGES project), taken with the APO 3.5m telescope, in order to study
their eDIG. We conduct an exponential fit to the vertical intensity profiles of
the sample galaxies, of which 16 can be decomposed into a thin disk plus an
extended thick disk component. The median value of the scale height (h) of the
extended component is $1.13\pm 0.14$ kpc. We find a tight sublinear correlation
between h and the SFR. Moreover, the offset of individual galaxies from the
best-fit SFR-h relation shows significant anti-correlation with SFR_SD. This
indicates that galaxies with more intense star formation tend to have
disproportionately extended eDIG. Combined with data from the literature, we
find that the correlations between the eDIG properties and the galaxies'
properties extend to broader ranges. We further compare the vertical extension
of the eDIG to multi-wavelength measurements of other CGM phases. We find the
eDIG to be slightly more extended than the neutral gas (HI 21-cm line),
indicating the existence of some extended ionizing sources. Most galaxies have
an X-ray scale height smaller than the h, suggesting that the majority of the
X-ray emission detected in shallow observations are actually from the thick
disk. The h is comparable to the L-band radio continuum scale height, both
slightly larger than that at higher frequencies (C-band), where the cooling is
stronger and the thermal contribution may be larger. The comparable H$\alpha$
and L-band scale height indicates that the thermal and non-thermal electrons
have similar spatial distributions. This further indicates that the thermal
gas, the cosmics rays, and the magnetic field may be close to energy
equipartition.
