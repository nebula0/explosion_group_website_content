# KiDS-Legacy calibration: unifying shear and redshift calibration with the SKiLLS multi-band image simulations

We present SKiLLS, a suite of multi-band image simulations for the
KiDS-Legacy analysis, the weak lensing analysis of the complete Kilo-Degree
Survey. The resulting catalogues enable joint shear and redshift calibration,
enhancing the realism and hence accuracy over previous efforts. To create a
large volume of simulated galaxies with faithful properties and to a sufficient
depth, we integrate cosmological simulations with high-quality imaging
observations. We also improve the realism of simulated images by allowing the
point spread function (PSF) to differ between CCD images, including stellar
density variations and varying noise levels between pointings. Using realistic
variable shear fields, we account for the impact of blended systems at
different redshifts. Although the overall correction is minor, we find a clear
redshift-bias correlation in the blending-only variable shear simulations,
indicating the non-trivial impact of this higher-order blending effect. We also
explore the impact of the PSF modelling errors and find a small but noticeable
effect on the shear bias. Finally, we conduct a series of sensitivity tests,
including changing the input galaxy properties. We conclude that our fiducial
shape measurement algorithm, lensfit, is robust within the requirements of
lensing analyses with KiDS. As for future weak lensing surveys with tighter
requirements, we suggest further investments in understanding the impact of
blends at different redshifts, improving the PSF modelling algorithm and
developing the shape measurement method to be less sensitive to the galaxy
properties.
