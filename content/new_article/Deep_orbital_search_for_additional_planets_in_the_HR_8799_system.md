 The HR 8799 system hosts four massive planets orbiting 15 and 80 AU. Studies
of the system's orbital stability and its outer debris disk open the
possibility of additional planets, both interior to and exterior to the known
system. Reaching a sufficient sensitivity to search for interior planets is
very challenging due to the combination of bright quasi static speckle noise
close to the stellar diffraction core and relatively fast orbital motion. In
this work, we present a deep L-band imaging campaign using NIRC2 at Keck
comprising 14 observing sequences. We further re-reduce archival data for a
total of 16.75 hours, one of the largest uniform datasets of a single direct
imaging target. Using a Bayesian modeling technique for detecting planets in
images while compensating for plausible orbital motion, we then present deep
limits on the existence of additional planets in the HR 8799 system. The final
combination shows a tentative candidate, consistent with 4-7 $M_{jup}$ at 4-5
AU, detected with an equivalent false alarm probability better than $3\sigma$.
This analysis technique is widely applicable to archival data and to new
observations from upcoming missions that revisit targets at multiple epochs.
