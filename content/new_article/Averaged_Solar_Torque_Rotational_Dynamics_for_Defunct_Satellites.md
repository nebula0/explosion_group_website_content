 Spin state predictions for defunct satellites in geosynchronous earth orbit
(GEO) are valuable for active debris removal and servicing missions as well as
material shedding studies and attitude-dependent solar radiation pressure (SRP)
modeling. Previous studies have shown that solar radiation torques can explain
the observed spin state evolution of some GEO objects via the
Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. These studies have focused
primarily on uniform rotation. Nevertheless, many objects are in non-principal
axis rotation (i.e. tumbling). Recent exploration of the tumbling regime for
the family of retired GOES 8-12 satellites has shown intriguing YORP-driven
behavior including spin-orbit coupling, tumbling cycles, and tumbling period
resonances. To better explore and understand the tumbling regime, we develop a
semi-analytical tumbling-averaged rotational dynamics model. The derivation
requires analytically averaging over the satellite's torque-free rotation,
defined by Jacobi elliptic functions. Averaging is facilitated by a second
order Fourier series approximation of the facet illumination function. The
averaged model is found to capture and explain the general long-term behavior
of the full dynamics while reducing computation time by roughly three orders of
magnitude. This improved computation efficiency promises to enable rapid
exploration of general long-term rotational dynamics for defunct satellites and
rocket bodies.
