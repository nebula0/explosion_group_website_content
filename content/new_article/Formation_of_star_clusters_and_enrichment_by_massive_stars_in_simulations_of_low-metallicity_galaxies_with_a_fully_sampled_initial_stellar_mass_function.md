 We present new GRIFFIN project hydrodynamical simulations that model the
formation of galactic star cluster populations in low-metallicity ($Z=0.00021$)
dwarf galaxies, including radiation, supernova and stellar wind feedback of
individual massive stars. In the simulations, stars are sampled from the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) down to the hydrogen burning limit of 0.08
M$_\odot$. Mass conservation is enforced within a radius of 1 pc for the
formation massive stars. We find that massive stars are preferentially found in
star clusters and follow a correlation set at birth between the highest initial
stellar mass and the star cluster mass, in agreement with observations. With a
fully sampled IMF, star clusters loose mass in the galactic tidal field
according to mass-loss rates observed in nearby galaxies. Of the released
stellar feedback, 60\% of the supernova material and up to 35\% of the wind
material reside either in the hot interstellar medium (ISM) or in gaseous,
metal enriched outflows. While stellar winds (instantaneously) and supernovae
(delayed) start enriching the ISM right after the first massive stars form, the
formation of supernova-enriched stars is significantly delayed (by $>50$ Myr)
compared to the formation of stars enriched by stellar winds. The first forming
star clusters are therefore solely enriched by stellar wind material. Overall,
supernova ejecta dominate the enrichment by mass, while the number of enriched
stars is determined by continuous stellar winds. These results present a
concept for the formation of chemically distinct populations of stars in bound
star clusters, reminiscent of multiple populations in globular clusters.
