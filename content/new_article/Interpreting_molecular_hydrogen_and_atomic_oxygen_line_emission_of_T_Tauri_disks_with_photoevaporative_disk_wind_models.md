 Winds in protoplanetary disks play an important role in their evolution and
dispersal. However, what physical process is driving the winds is still unclear
(i.e. magnetically vs thermally driven), and can only be understood by directly
confronting theoretical models with observational data. We use hydrodynamic
photoevaporative disk wind models and post-process them with a thermo-chemical
model to produce synthetic observables for the o-H$_2$ at 2.12 micron and [OI]
at 0.63 micron spectral lines and directly compare the results to a sample of
observations. Our photoevaporative disk wind model is consistent with the
observed signatures of the blue-shifted narrow low-velocity component (NLVC),
usually associated with slow disk winds, for both tracers. Only for one out of
seven targets that show blue-shifted NLVCs, the photoevaporative model cannot
explain the observed line kinematics. Our results also indicate that
interpreting spectral line profiles by simple methods, such as the thin-disk
approximation, to determine the line-emitting region can yield misleading
conclusions. The photoevaporative disk-wind models are largely consistent with
the studied observational data set, but it is not possible to clearly
discriminate between different wind-driving mechanisms. Further improvements to
the models, such as consistent modelling of the dynamics and chemistry and
detailed modelling of individual targets, are necessary. Furthermore, a direct
comparison of magnetically driven disk-wind models to the observational data
set is necessary to determine if spatially unresolved observations of multiple
wind tracers are sufficient to discriminate between theoretical models.
