 We revisit the modal analysis of small perturbations in Keplerian ideal gas
flows with constant vertical magnetic field leading to magneto-rotational
instability (MRI) using the non-local approach. In the general case, MRI modes
are described by a Schr\"odinger-like differential equation with some effective
potential including 'repulsive' ($1/r^2$) and 'attractive' ($-1/r^3$) terms and
are quantized. In shallow potentials, there are no stationary 'energy levels'.
In thin Keplerian accretion discs, the perturbation wavelengths
$\lambda=2\pi/k_z$ are smaller than the disc semi-thickness $h$ only in 'deep'
potential wells. We find that there is a critical magnetic field for the MRI to
develop. The instability arises for magnetic field below this critical value.
In thin accretion discs, at low background Alfv\'en velocity $c_A\ll
(c_A)_\mathrm{cr}$ the MRI instability increment $\omega$ is suppressed
compared to the value obtained in the local perturbation analysis,
$\omega\approx -\sqrt{3}\mathrm{i}c_Ak_z$. We also investigate for the first
time the case of radially variable background magnetic field.
