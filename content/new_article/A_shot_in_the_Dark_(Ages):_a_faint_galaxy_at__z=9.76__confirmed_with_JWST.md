 The appearance of galaxies over the first billion years after the Big Bang is
believed to be responsible for the last dramatic change in the state of the
Universe. Ultraviolet photons from galaxies within this time period - the Epoch
of Reionization - ionized intergalactic Hydrogen, rendering the Universe
transparent to UV radiation and ending the so-called cosmic Dark Ages, sometime
after redshift $z\sim8$. The majority of ionizing photons in the first few
hundred Myrs of cosmic history are thought to derive from galaxies
significantly fainter than the characteristic luminosity $L^{*}$. These faint
galaxies are thought to be surrounded by sufficient neutral gas to prevent the
escape of the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons that would allow confirmation with current
observatories. Here we demonstrate the power of the recently commissioned James
Webb Space Telescope to transform our understanding of the sources of
reionization, by reporting the first spectroscopic confirmation of a very low
luminosity ($\sim0.05 L^{*}$) galaxy at $z=9.76$, observed 480 Myr after the
Big Bang, via the detection of the Lyman-break and redward continuum with the
NIRSpec and NIRCam instruments. The galaxy JD1 is gravitationally magnified by
a factor of $\mu\sim13$ by the foreground cluster A2744. The power of JWST and
lensing allows us to peer deeper than ever before into the cosmic Dark Ages,
revealing the compact ($\sim$150 pc) and complex morphology and physical
properties of an ultrafaint galaxy ($M_{\rm UV}=-17.45$).
