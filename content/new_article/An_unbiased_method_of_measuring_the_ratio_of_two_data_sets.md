 In certain cases of astronomical data analysis, the meaningful physical
quantity to extract is the ratio $R$ between two data sets. Examples include
the lensing ratio, the interloper rate in spectroscopic redshift samples, the
decay rate of gravitational potential and $E_G$ to test gravity. However,
simply taking the ratio of the two data sets is biased, since it renders (even
statistical) errors in the denominator into systematic errors in $R$.
Furthermore, it is not optimal in minimizing statistical errors of $R$. Based
on the Bayesian analysis and the usual assumption of Gaussian error in the
data, we derive an analytical expression of the posterior PDF $P(R)$. This
result enables fast and unbiased $R$ measurement, with minimal statistical
errors. Furthermore, it relies on no underlying model other than the
proportionality relation between the two data sets. Even more generally, it
applies to the cases where the proportionality relation holds for the
underlying physics/statistics instead of the two data sets directly. It also
applies to the case of multiple ratios ($R\rightarrow {\bf
R}=(R_1,R_2,\cdots)$). We take the lensing ratio as an example to demonstrate
our method. We take lenses as DESI imaging survey galaxies, and sources as
DECaLS cosmic shear and \emph{Planck} CMB lensing. We restrict the analysis to
the ratio between CMB lensing and cosmic shear. The resulting $P(R$), for
multiple lens-shear pairs, are all nearly Gaussian. The S/N of measured $R$
ranges from $5.3$ to $8.4$. We perform several tests to verify the robustness
of the above result.
