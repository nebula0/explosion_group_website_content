 The detected polarized radio emission from remnant of SN1987A opens the
possibility to unveil the structure of the pre-supernova magnetic field in the
circumstellar medium. Properties derived from direct measurements would be of
importance for understanding the progenitor stars and their magnetic fields. As
the first step to this goal, we adopted the hydrodynamic data from an
elaborated three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model of SN1987A. We have
developed an approximate method for `reconstruction' of 3-D magnetic field
structure inside supernova remnant on the `hydrodynamic background'. This
method uses the distribution of the magnetic field around the progenitor as the
initial condition. With such a 3-D magneto-hydrodynamic model, we have
synthesized the polarization maps for a number of SN1987A models and compared
them to the observations. In this way, we have tested different initial
configurations of the magnetic field as well as a structure of the synchrotron
emission in SN987A. We have recovered the observed polarization pattern and we
have found that the radial component of the ambient pre-supernova magnetic
field should be dominant on the length-scale of the present-day radius of
SN1987A. The physical reasons for such a field are discussed.
