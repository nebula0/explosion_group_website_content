 Massive ($\geq$8 $M_\odot$) stars perish via one of two fates: core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe), which release synthesized heavy elements, or failed
supernovae, thereby forming black holes. In the conventional Galactic chemical
evolution (GCE) scheme, a substantial portion of massive stars, e.g., all stars
in the mass range of 8-100 $M_{\odot},$ are assumed to enrich the Galaxy with
their nucleosynthetic products. However, this hypothesis conflicts with the
observations, namely, few CCSNe whose progenitor stars are more massive than
$\sim$18 $M_{\odot}.$ Here, we show that the chemical characteristics shaped by
local thin disk stars are compatible with the predictions by enrichment via
CCSNe limited to less massive progenitors in the new paradigm of Galactic
dynamics that allows stars to migrate from the inner disk. This renewed GCE
model predicts that the bursting star formation events$-$which are considered
to take place in the Galactic bulge as well as in the thick disk$-$generate
more numerous low-mass CCSNe than those expected from the locally determined
canonical initial mass function. This finding suggests a high rate of CCSNe in
early-type galaxies, which reflects a unique cosmic history of the CCSN rate.
With considerable contributions from these galaxies to the cosmic star
formation rates in the early Universe, we predict a more steeply increasing
slope of the CCSN rate with increasing redshift than that in proportion to
cosmic star formation. This predicted redshift evolution agrees well with the
measured rates for 0 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 0.8; however, its predicted CCSN
rate for higher-$z$ calls for more precise data from future surveys.
