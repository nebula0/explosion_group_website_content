 Abrupt and permanent photospheric magnetic field changes have been observed
in many flares. It is believed that such changes are related to the
reconfiguration of magnetic field lines, however, the real origin is still
unclear. In this study we analyze 37 flares to understand the magnetic field
vector changes in the photosphere using high-cadence (135 s) vector
magnetograms obtained from the HMI/SDO. We also co-align these magnetogram
sequences with flare ribbon images (1600 \AA), obtained from the AIA/SDO, to
understand how the field change is associated with the ribbon morphology. We
find that the permanent change in the horizontal component lies near the
polarity inversion line, whereas the vertical component pixels are less
pronounced and distributed in small patches. We also find that the pixels
exhibiting ultraviolet emission are not always associated with permanent field
change. In 84% of 37 events the UV emission starts early by several minutes
compared to the field change start time for the pixels showing both UV emission
and permanent horizontal field change. The field change properties show no
relation with the size of active regions, but are strongly related to the flare
ribbon properties like ribbon magnetic flux and ribbon area. The permanent
field change duration is strongly correlated with the GOES flaring duration,
with an average value of 29% of total GOES flare time. Our analysis suggests
that the change in photospheric magnetic field is caused by combination of two
scenarios: contraction of flare loops driven by magnetic reconnection and
coronal implosion.
