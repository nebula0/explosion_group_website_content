 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in regulating gas flows
around galaxies and thus shapes their evolution. However, the details of how
galaxies and their CGM co-evolve remain poorly understood. We present a new
time-dependent two-zone model that self-consistently tracks not just mass and
metal flows between galaxies and their CGM but also the evolution of the global
thermal and turbulent kinetic energy of the CGM. Our model accounts for heating
and turbulence driven by both supernova winds and cosmic accretion as well as
radiative cooling, turbulence dissipation, and halo outflows due to CGM
overpressurization. We demonstrate that, depending on parameters, the CGM can
undergo a phase transition (``thermalization'') from a cool,
turbulence-supported phase to a virial-temperature, thermally-supported phase.
This CGM phase transition is largely determined by the ability of radiative
cooling to balance heating from supernova winds and turbulence dissipation. We
perform an initial calibration of our model to the FIRE-2 cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations and show that it is remarkably successful in
reproducing the baryon cycles of the simulated galaxies and their CGM. In
particular, we find that, for these parameters, the phase transition occurs at
high-redshift in ultrafaint progenitors and at low redshift in classical
$M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{11}M_{\odot}$ dwarfs, while Milky Way-mass halos undergo
the transition at $z\approx0.5$, in agreement with the simulations. We discuss
the ways in which our model is complementary to existing approaches for
modeling the CGM--galaxy connection and possible future directions.
