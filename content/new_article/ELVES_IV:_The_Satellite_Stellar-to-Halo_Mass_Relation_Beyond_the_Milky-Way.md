 Quantifying the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos
has been key for testing cosmological models on various scales. Below $M_\star
\sim 10^9\,M_\odot$, such studies have primarily relied on the satellite galaxy
population orbiting the Milky Way. Here we present new constraints on the
connection between satellite galaxies and their host dark matter subhalos using
the largest sample of satellite galaxies in the Local Volume ($D \lesssim
12\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) to date. We use $250$ confirmed and $71$ candidate dwarf
satellites around 27 Milky Way (MW)-like hosts from the Exploration of Local
VolumE Satellites (ELVES) Survey and use the semi-analytical SatGen model for
predicting the population of dark matter subhalos expected in the same volume.
Through a Bayesian model comparison of the observed and the forward-modeled
satellite stellar mass functions (SSMF), we infer the satellite stellar-to-halo
mass relation. We find that the observed SSMF is best reproduced when subhalos
are populated by a relation of the form $M_\star \propto
M^\alpha_\mathrm{peak}$, with a moderate slope of $\alpha=2.0 \pm 0.1$, and a
scatter that grows with decreasing $M_\mathrm{peak}$. We find a significantly
larger scatter towards lower peak halo masses, compared to prior studies that
relied mainly on MW satellites. We conclude that this scatter results from a
combination of star formation stochasticity and host-to-host scatter. Our new
model for the satellite-subhalo connection has important implications for both
of these baryonic-impacted effects, as well as on dark matter physics.
