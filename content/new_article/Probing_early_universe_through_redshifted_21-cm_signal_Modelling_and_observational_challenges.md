The redshifted 21-cm radiation from the atomic hydrogen (HI) provides an excellent direct probe to study the evolution of HI in IGM and thus reveal the nature of the first luminous objects, their evolution and role during Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR), and formation and evolution of the structures thereafter. Direct mapping of the HI density during the CD-EoR is rather difficult with the current and future instruments due to large foreground and other observational contamination. The first detection of this redshifted HI signal is planned through statistical estimators. Given the utmost importance of the detection and analysis of the redshifted 21-cm signal, physics of CD-EoR is one of the objectives of the upcoming SKA-Low telescope. This paper summarizes the collective effort of Indian astronomers to understand the origin of the redshifted 21-cm signal, sources of first ionizing photons, their propagation through the IGM, various cosmological effects on the expected 21-cm signal, various statistical measures of the signal like power spectrum, bispectrum, etc. A collective effort on detection of the signal by developing estimators of the statistical measures with rigorous assessment of their expected uncertainties, various challenges like that of the large foreground emission and calibration issues are also discussed. Various versions of the detection methods discussed here have also been used in practice with the GMRT with successful assessment of the foreground contamination and upper limits on the matter density in EoR and post-EoR. The collective efforts compiled here has been a large part of the global effort to prepare proper observational technique and analysis procedure for the first light of the CD-EoR through the SKA-Low.
