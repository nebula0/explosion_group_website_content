 Very recently, the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array collaborations reported
strong evidence for a correlation between the highest energy cosmic rays and
nearby starburst galaxies, with a global significance post-trial of
$4.6\sigma$. It is well known that the collective effect of supernovae and
winds from massive stars in the central region of these galaxies drives a
galactic-scale superwind that can shock heat and accelerate ambient
interstellar or circumgalactic gas. In previous work we showed that, for
reasonable source parameters, starburst-driven superwinds can be the carriers
of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray acceleration. In this paper we assess the
extent to which one can approach the archaeological ``inverse'' problem of
deciphering properties of superwind evolution from present-day IR emission of
their host galaxies. We show that the Outer Limits galaxy NGC 891 could provide
``smoking gun evidence'' for the starburst-driven superwind model of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.
