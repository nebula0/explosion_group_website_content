 Magnetic fields are responsible for a multitude of Solar phenomena, including
such destructive events as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, with the
number of such events rising as we approach the peak of the 11-year solar
cycle, in approximately 2025. High-precision spectropolarimetric observations
are necessary to understand the variability of the Sun. The field of
quantitative inference of magnetic field vectors and related solar atmospheric
parameters from such observations has long been investigated. In recent years,
very sophisticated codes for spectropolarimetric observations have been
developed. Over the past two decades, neural networks have been shown to be a
fast and accurate alternative to classic inversion technique methods. However,
most of these codes can be used to obtain point estimates of the parameters, so
ambiguities, the degeneracies, and the uncertainties of each parameter remain
uncovered. In this paper, we provide end-to-end inversion codes based on the
simple Milne-Eddington model of the stellar atmosphere and deep neural networks
to both parameter estimation and their uncertainty intervals. The proposed
framework is designed in such a way that it can be expanded and adapted to
other atmospheric models or combinations of them. Additional information can
also be incorporated directly into the model. It is demonstrated that the
proposed architecture provides high accuracy of results, including a reliable
uncertainty estimation, even in the multidimensional case. The models are
tested using simulation and real data samples.
