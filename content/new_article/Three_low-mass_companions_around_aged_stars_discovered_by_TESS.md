 We report the discovery of three transiting low-mass companions to aged
stars: a brown dwarf (TOI-2336b) and two objects near the hydrogen burning mass
limit (TOI-1608b and TOI-2521b). These three systems were first identified
using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TOI-2336b has
a radius of $1.05\pm 0.04\ R_J$, a mass of $69.9\pm 2.3\ M_J$ and an orbital
period of 7.71 days. TOI-1608b has a radius of $1.21\pm 0.06\ R_J$, a mass of
$90.7\pm 3.7\ M_J$ and an orbital period of 2.47 days. TOI-2521b has a radius
of $1.01\pm 0.04\ R_J$, a mass of $77.5\pm 3.3\ M_J$ and an orbital period of
5.56 days. We found all these low-mass companions are inflated. We fitted a
relation between radius, mass and incident flux using the sample of known
transiting brown dwarfs and low-mass M dwarfs. We found a positive correlation
between the flux and the radius for brown dwarfs and for low-mass stars that is
weaker than the correlation observed for giant planets.
