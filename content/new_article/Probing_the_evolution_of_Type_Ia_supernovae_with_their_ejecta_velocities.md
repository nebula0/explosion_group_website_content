 There is growing evidence that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely
produced via multiple explosion channels. Understanding how different channels
evolve with redshift is critical in determining their precision in measuring
cosmological parameters. Previous studies indicated that SN Ia ejecta velocity
is one powerful tool to differentiate between different channels. It was also
suspected that the tight correlation with the host-galaxy environment could
result in the evolution of SN ejecta velocities. In this work, we measure the
Si II 6355 velocities from ~400 confirmed SNe Ia discovered by the Pan-STARRS1
Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS), and combine them with the SNe discovered by
different surveys to form a large compilation of velocity measurements. For the
first time, we find that the SNe Ia with faster Si II 6355 have a significantly
different redshift distribution from their slower counterparts (with a p-value
of 0.00008 from the K-S test), in the sense that HV SNe Ia are more likely to
be found at lower redshift. The trend may suggest a strong evolution of SN Ia
ejecta velocity, or imply that the SN Ia demographics (as distinguished by
their ejecta velocities) are likely to vary with time. Our results also imply
that the progenitor system of HV SNe Ia (and possibly some NV SNe Ia) may favor
a metal-rich environment and/or scenarios of long delay time. However, we do
not see a significant difference (in ~2 sigma) in Hubble residuals when
splitting our sample based on the Si II 6355 velocity.
