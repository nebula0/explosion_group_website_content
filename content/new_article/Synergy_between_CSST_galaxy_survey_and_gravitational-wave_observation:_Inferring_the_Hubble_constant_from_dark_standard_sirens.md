 Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences encode the
absolute luminosity distances of GW sources. Once the redshifts of GW sources
are known, one can use the distance-redshift relation to constrain cosmological
parameters. One way to obtain the redshifts is to localize GW sources by GW
observations and then use galaxy catalogs to determine redshifts from a
statistical analysis of redshift information of the potential host galaxies,
and such GW data are commonly referred to as dark sirens. The third-generation
(3G) GW detectors are planned to work in the 2030s and will observe numerous
compact binary coalescences. Using these GW events as dark sirens requires
high-quality galaxy catalogs from future sky survey projects. The China Space
Station Telescope (CSST) will be launched in 2024 and will observe billions of
galaxies within a 17500 deg$^2$ survey area up to $z\sim 4$, providing
photometric and spectroscopic galaxy catalogs. In this work, we simulate the
CSST galaxy catalog and the 5-year GW data, and combine them to infer the
Hubble constant ($H_0$). Our results show that the measurement precision of
$H_0$ could reach better than $0.005\%$, which is an astonishing precision for
the Hubble constant measurement. We conclude that the synergy between the 3G GW
detectors and CSST will be of far-reaching importance in dark-siren cosmology.
