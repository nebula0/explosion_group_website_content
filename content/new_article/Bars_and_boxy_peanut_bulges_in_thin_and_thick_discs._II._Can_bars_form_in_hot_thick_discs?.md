 The Milky Way as well as external galaxies possess a thick disc. However, the
dynamical role of the (geometrically) thick disc on the bar formation and
evolution is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the effect of thick
discs in bar formation and evolution by means of a suite of $N$-body models of
(kinematically cold) thin-(kinematically hot) thick discs. We systematically
vary the mass fraction of the thick disc, the thin-to-thick disc scale length
ratio as well as thick disc's scale height to examine the bar formation under
diverse dynamical scenarios. Bars form almost always in our models, even in
presence of a massive thick disc. The bar in the thick disc closely follow the
overall growth and temporal evolution of the thin disc's bar, only the bar in
the thick disc is weaker than the bar in the thin disc. The formation of
stronger bars is associated with a simultaneous larger loss of angular momentum
and a larger radial heating. In addition, we demonstrate a preferential loss of
angular momentum and a preferential radial heating of disc stars, along the
azimuthal direction within the extent of the bar, in both thin and thick disc
stars. For purely thick disc models (without any thin disc), the bar formation
critically depends on the disc scale length and scale height. A larger scale
length and/or a larger vertical scale height delays the bar formation time
and/or suppresses the bar formation almost completely in thick-disc-only
models. We find that the Ostriker-Peeble criterion predicts the bar instability
scenarios in our models better than the Efstathiou-Lake-Negroponte criterion.
