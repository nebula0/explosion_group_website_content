 The spatial distribution of galaxies and their gravitational lensing signal
offer complementary tests of galaxy formation physics and cosmology. However,
their synergy can only be fully exploited if both probes are modelled
accurately and consistently. In this paper, we demonstrate that this can be
achieved using an extension of Subhalo Abundance Matching, dubbed SHAMe.
Specifically, we use mock catalogues built from the TNG300 hydrodynamical
simulation to show that SHAMe can simultaneously model the multipoles of the
redshift-space galaxy correlation function and galaxy-galaxy lensing, without
noticeable bias within the statistical sampling uncertainties of a SDSS volume
and on scales r = [0.6-30] Mpc/h. Modelling the baryonic processes in
galaxy-galaxy lensing with a baryonification scheme allows SHAMe's range of
validity to be extended to r = [0.1-30] Mpc/h. Remarkably, our model achieves
this level of precision with just five free parameters beyond those describing
the baryonification model. At fixed cosmology, we find that galaxy-galaxy
lensing provides a general consistency test but little additional information
on galaxy modelling parameters beyond that encoded in the redshift-space
multipoles. It does, however, improve constraints if only the projected
correlation function is available, as in surveys with only photometric
redshifts. We expect SHAMe to have a higher fidelity across a wider range of
scales than more traditional methods such as Halo Occupation Distribution
modelling. Thus it should provide a significantly more powerful and more robust
tool for analysing next-generation large-scale surveys.
