 The first James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) image released was of galaxy
cluster SMACSJ0723.3- 7327, a lensing cluster at z=0.39 showing detail only
JWST can provide. While the majority of the focus has been on the brilliantly
lensed galaxies at redshifts far beyond it, there is more to the story than it
being just a lensing cluster. The Chandra X-ray temperature map tells a tale of
a merging cluster with a significant subcluster leaving a wake in the
intracluster medium (ICM). This paper presents a high fidelity temperature map
of SMACSJ0723.3-7327 using adaptive circular binning, overlaid with the JWST
image, showing clear signs of merger activity. As the ICM extends well past the
boundaries of the JWST imagery, and no low-frequency radio observations are yet
published, a fuller story of this cluster remains to be told. This new X-ray
temperature map reveals new details of a moderately distant actively merging
cluster.
