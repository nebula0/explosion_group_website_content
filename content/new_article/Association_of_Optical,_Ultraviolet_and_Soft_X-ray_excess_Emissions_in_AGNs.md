 Soft X-ray emission (0.5--2.0 keV) plays a pivotal role in regulating the
optical and UV emission in the AGNs. We collected a sample of 1811 AGNs from
the SDSS database and obtained various parameters of Balmer lines, optical
continuum, MgII line \& UV continuum and studied their dependencies on soft
X-ray luminosity. Based on the linear regression analysis, we found that
FWHM$_{\text{MgII}}$ $\propto$ FWHM$_{\text{H}\beta}^{0.554}$ suggesting that
UV emission is arising from a region relatively outside the broad line region
(BLR) associated to the H$\beta$ emission and found a strong correlation
between optical and UV luminosities (L$_{\text{MgII}}$ $\propto$
L$_{\text{H}\beta}^{0.822}$). It was noticed that the dependency of optical
continuum luminosities on soft excess changes with the redshift (L$_{\text{X}}$
$\propto$ L$^{0.596}_{5100\text{\AA}}$ for z < 0.5 and L$_{\text{X}}$ $\propto$
L$^{0.429}_{5100\text{\AA}}$ for z > 0.5). The FWHM components of H${\beta}$
and MgII core components were found to be virialized and is not affected by the
soft excess emission whereas the wings of MgII display a dependency. We
estimated a relation viz. L$_{\text{X}}$ $\propto$L$^{0.520}_{3000\text{\AA}}$
FWHM$^{0.525}_{\text{MgII}}$ and found to be well in agreement with a proposed
physical scenario. All the derived relations were used to understand the
inter-modulating association of the BLR and disc in the AGNs.
