 The WALLABY pilot survey has been conducted using the Australian SKA
Pathfinder (ASKAP). The integrated 21-cm HI line spectra are formed in a very
different manner compared to usual single-dish spectra Tully-Fisher
measurements. It is thus extremely important to ensure that slight differences
(e.g. biases due to missing flux) are quantified and understood in order to
maximise the use of the large amount of data becoming available soon. This
article is based on four fields for which the data are scientifically
interesting by themselves. The pilot data discussed here consist of 614 galaxy
spectra at a rest wavelength of 21cm. Of these spectra, 472 are of high enough
quality to be used to potentially derive distances using the Tully-Fisher
relation. We further restrict the sample to the 251 galaxies whose inclination
is sufficiently close to edge-on. For these, we derive Tully-Fisher distances
using the deprojected WALLABY velocity widths combined with infrared (WISE W1)
magnitudes. The resulting Tully-Fisher distances for the Eridanus, Hydra, Norma
and NGC 4636 clusters are 21.5, 53.5, 69.4 and 23.0 Mpc respectively, with
uncertainties of 5--10\%, which are better or equivalent to the ones obtained
in studies using data obtained with giant single dish telescopes. The pilot
survey data show the benefits of WALLABY over previous giant single-dish
telescope surveys. WALLABY is expected to detect around half a million galaxies
with a mean redshift of $z = 0.05 (200 Mpc)$. This study suggests that about
200,000 Tully-Fisher distances might result from the survey.
