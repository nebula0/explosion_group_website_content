 We investigate the effect of photon-ALP oscillations on the gamma-ray spectra
of TXS 0506+056 using observations by Fermi Large Area Telescope (FERMI-LAT)
and Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC) data. We
individually used both the quiescent and the two VHE flaring phases around
IC170922-A and additionally, the 2014 neutrino flare phase for the source to
study the ALP effect at sub-PeV energies.
