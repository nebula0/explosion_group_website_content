 Galaxies broadly fall into two categories: star-forming (blue) galaxies and
quiescent (red) galaxies. In between, one finds the less populated ``green
valley". Some of these galaxies are suspected to be in the process of ceasing
their star-formation through a gradual exhaustion of gas supply or already dead
and are experiencing a rejuvenation of star-formation through fuel injection.
We use the Galaxy And Mass Assembly database and the Galaxy Zoo citizen science
morphological estimates to compare the morphology of galaxies in the green
valley against those in the red sequence and blue cloud.
  Our goal is to examine the structural differences within galaxies that fall
in the green valley, and what brings them there. Previous results found disc
features such as rings and lenses are more prominently represented in the green
valley population. We revisit this with a similar sized data set of galaxies
with morphology labels provided by the Galaxy Zoo for the GAMA fields based on
new KiDS images. Our aim is to compare qualitatively the results from expert
classification to that of citizen science.
  We observe that ring structures are indeed found more commonly in green
valley galaxies compared to their red and blue counterparts. We suggest that
ring structures are a consequence of disc galaxies in the green valley actively
exhibiting characteristics of fading discs and evolving disc morphology of
galaxies. We note that the progression from blue to red correlates with
loosening spiral arm structure.
