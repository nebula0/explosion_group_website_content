 We explore the parameter space for the contribution to Callisto's H corona
observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (Roth et al. 2017a) from sublimated H2O
and radiolytically produced H2 using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
method. The spatial morphology of this corona produced via photo- and
magnetospheric electron impact-induced dissociation is described by tracking
the motion of and simulating collisions between the hot H atoms and thermal
molecules including a near-surface O2 component. Our results indicate that
sublimated H2O produced from the surface ice, whether assumed to be intimately
mixed with or distinctly segregated from the dark non-ice or ice-poor regolith,
cannot explain the observed structure of the H corona. On the other hand, a
global H2 component can reproduced the observation, and is also capable of
producing the enhanced electron densities observed at high altitudes by
Galileo's plasma-wave instrument (Gurnett et al., 1997, 2000), providing the
first evidence of H2 in Callisto's atmosphere. The range of H2 surface
densities explored, under a variety of conditions, that are consistent with
these observations is ~(0.4-1)x10^8 cm^-3. The simulated H2 escape rates and
estimated lifetimes suggest that Callisto has a neutral H2 torus. We also place
a rough upper limit on the peak H2O number density (<~10^8 cm^-3), column
density (<~10^15 cm^-2), and sublimation flux (<~10^12 cm^-2 s^-1), all of
which are 1-2 orders of magnitude less than that assumed in previous models.
Finally, we discuss the implications of these results, as well as how they
compare to Europa and Ganymede.
