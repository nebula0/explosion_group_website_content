 To probe the current theory on galaxy formation and evolution, an increased
synergy between observations and simulations is necessary. For this reason, in
our previous paper of this series, we presented a method to mock SDSS-IV/MaNGA
integral-field spectroscopic galaxy observations from cosmological simulations
of galaxy formation. Here we present the resulting mock galaxy catalogue. This
catalogue consists of 1,000 unique galaxies in IllustrisTNG-50 falling into the
SDSS-IV/MaNGA-primary target footprint, defined in the redshift and i-band
absolute magnitude space. In this paper, we describe the general
characteristics of the catalogue, in terms of morphology, kinematics, and
stellar population properties. We also investigate our ability to recover the
galaxy characteristics, as given by the simulations, analysing the synthetic
spectra. We show that the `intrinsic' and recovered kinematics, age and
metallicity are consistent within 1${\sigma}$, with residuals over all tassels
($\sim 8$ million) consistent with $0$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. We also
compare `intrinsic' and recovered star formation histories, finding a close
resemblance. Therefore, our mocking and spectral fitting processes do not
distort intrinsic galaxy properties, hence we can use these results for
scientific analysis. In the next papers of this series, we will present a
comprehensive comparison and scientific analysis of TNG50 simulations with
MaNGA observational results.
