 We search for a spatial association between radio pulsars and ultra-high
energy neutrinos using the publicly available IceCube point source neutrino
events catalog. For this purpose we use the unbinned maximum likelihood method
to search for a statistically significant excess from each of the pulsars in
the ATNF catalog. We do not find any pulsars with detection significance much
higher than that expected from a Gaussian distribution, Therefore, we conclude
that none of the currently known pulsars contribute to the diffuse neutrino
flux detected by IceCube.
