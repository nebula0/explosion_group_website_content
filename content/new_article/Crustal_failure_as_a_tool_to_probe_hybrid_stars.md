 It is currently unknown if neutron stars are composed of nucleons only or are
hybrid stars, i.e., in addition to nucleonic crusts and outer cores, they also
possess quark cores. Quantum chromodynamics allows for such a phase transition
possibility, but accurate calculations in the range of interest for compact
stars are still elusive. Here we investigate some crust-breaking aspects of
hybrid stars. We show that the crust-breaking orbital/gravitational wave
frequency and maximum ellipticity are sensitive to the quark-hadron density
jump and equation of state stiffness. Remarkably, the crust-breaking frequency
related to static tides scales linearly with the mass of the star (for a given
companion's mass), and its slope encompasses information about the microphysics
of the star. When a liquid quark core touches an elastic hadronic phase, which
could be the result of a significant energy-density jump, the maximum
ellipticity can increase orders of magnitude when compared to the case the
liquid quark core touches a liquid hadronic phase, such as the outer core. Our
analysis also suggests that a given upper limit to the ellipticity or a
crust-breaking frequency could have representatives in stars with either small
or very large energy-density jumps. Therefore, upper limits to the ellipticity
from continuous gravitational wave observations of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network
for isolated stars, and gamma-ray precursors associated with crust breaking in
inspiraling binary systems may constrain some aspects of phase transitions in
neutron stars.
