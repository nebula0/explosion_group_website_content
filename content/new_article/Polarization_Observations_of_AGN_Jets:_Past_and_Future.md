 The magnetic field is believed to play a critical role in the bulk
acceleration and propagation of jets produced in active galactic nuclei (AGN).
Polarization observations of AGN jets provide valuable information about their
magnetic fields. As a result of radiative transfer, jet structure, and
stratification, among other factors, it is not always straightforward to
determine the magnetic field structures from observed polarization. We review
these effects and their impact on polarization emission at a variety of
wavelengths, including radio, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths in this
paper. It is also possible to study the magnetic field in the launching and
acceleration regions of AGN jets by using very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI), which occurs on a small physical scale. Due to the weak polarization of
the jets in these regions, probing the magnetic field is generally difficult.
However, recent VLBI observations have detected significant polarization and
Faraday rotation in some nearby sources. We present the results of these
observations as well as prospects for future observations. Additionally, we
briefly discuss recently developed polarization calibration and imaging
techniques for VLBI data, which enable more in-depth analysis of the magnetic
field structure around supermassive black holes and in AGN jets.
