 Galaxies, diffuse gas and dark matter make up the cosmic web defining the
large-scale structure of the universe. We constrain the joint distribution of
these constituents by cross-correlating galaxy samples binned by stellar mass
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey CMASS catalogue with maps of lensing
convergence and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect from the Planck
mission. Fitting a halo-based model to our measured angular power spectra
(galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-lensing convergence, galaxy-tSZ) at a median redshift of
$z=0.53$, we detect variation with stellar mass of the galaxy satellite
fraction and galaxy spatial distribution within host halos. We find a tSZ-halo
hydrostatic mass bias, $b_h$, such that $(1-b_h)=0.6\pm0.05$, with a hint of
larger bias, $b_h$, at the high stellar mass end. The normalization of the
galaxy-lensing convergence cross-power spectrum shows that galaxies trace the
matter distribution with no indication of stochasticity ($A=0.97\pm 0.09$). We
forecast that next generation cosmic microwave background experiments will
improve constraints on the hydrostatic bias by a factor of two and be able to
constrain the small-scale distribution of dark matter, hence informing theory
on feedback processes.
