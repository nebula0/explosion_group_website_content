 Massive black holes in the centers of galaxies today must have grown by
several orders of magnitude from seed black holes formed at early times.
Detecting a population of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) can provide
constraints on these elusive BH seeds. Here we use the large volume,
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Astrid, which includes IMBH seeds and
dynamical friction to investigate the population of IMBH seeds. Dynamical
friction is largely inefficient at sinking and merging seed IMBHs at high-z.
This leads to an extensive population (several hundred per galaxy) of wandering
IMBHs in large halos at z~2. A small fraction of these IMBHs are detectable as
HLXs, Hyper Luminous X-ray sources. Importantly, at z ~ 2, IMBHs mergers
produce the peak of GW events. We find close to a million GW events in Astrid
between z=2-3 involving seed IMBH mergers. These GW events (almost all
detectable by LISA) at cosmic noon should provide strong constraints on IMBH
seed models and their formation mechanisms. At the center of massive galaxies,
where the number of IMBHs can be as high as 10-100, SMBH-IMBH pairs can form.
These Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) and extreme mass ratio
inspirals (EMRIs), will require the next generation of milli-muHz space-based
GW interferometers to be detected. Large populations of IMBHs around massive
black holes will probe their environments and MBH causal structure.
