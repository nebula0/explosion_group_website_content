 We aim to reveal the structure and kinematics of the Outer-Scutum-Centaurus
(OSC) arm located on the far side of the Milky Way through very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) astrometry using KaVA, which is composed of KVN (Korean
VLBI Network) and VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry). We report the
proper motion of a 22 GHz H$_{2}$O maser source, which is associated with the
star-forming region G034.84$-$00.95, to be ($\mu_{\alpha} \rm{cos}\delta$,
$\mu_{\delta}$) = ($-$1.61$\pm$0.18, $-$4.29$\pm$0.16) mas yr$^{-1}$ in
equatorial coordinates (J2000). We estimate the 2D kinematic distance to the
source to be 18.6$\pm$1.0 kpc, which is derived from the variance-weighted
average of kinematic distances with LSR velocity and the Galactic-longitude
component of the measured proper motion. Our result places the source in the
OSC arm and implies that G034.84$-$00.95 is moving away from the Galactic plane
with a vertical velocity of $-$38$\pm$16 km s$^{-1}$. Since the H I supershell
GS033+06$-$49 is located at a kinematic distance roughly equal to that of
G034.84$-$00.95, it is expected that gas circulation occurs between the outer
Galactic disk around G034.84$-$00.95 with a Galactocentric distance of
12.8$^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$ kpc and halo. We evaluate possible origins of the fast
vertical motion of G034.84$-$00.95, which are (1) supernova explosions and (2)
cloud collisions with the Galactic disk. However, neither of the possibilities
are matched with the results of VLBI astrometry as well as spatial
distributions of H II regions and H I gas.
