 Broad emitting line regions (BLR) in active galaxies are primarily emitted by
photoionization processes that are driven by the incident continuum arising
from the underlying, complex geometrical structure, i.e. accretion disk and
corona around a supermassive black hole. Modelling the broad-band spectral
energy distribution (SED) effective in ionizing the gas-rich BLR is key to
understanding the various radiative processes at play and their importance that
eventually leads to the emission of emission lines from diverse physical
conditions. Photoionization codes are a useful tool to investigate two aspects
- the importance of the shape of the SED, and the physical conditions in the
BLR. In this work, we provide the first results focusing on a long-standing
issue pertaining to the anisotropic continuum radiation from the very centres
(few 10-100 gravitational radii) of these active galaxies. The anisotropic
emission is a direct consequence of the development of a geometrically and
optically thick structure at regions very close to the black hole due to a
marked increase in the accretion rates. Incorporating the radiation emerging
from such a structure in our photoionization modelling, we are successful in
replicating the observed emission line intensities, in addition to the
remarkable agreement on the location of the BLR with current reverberation
mapping estimates. This study took advantage of the look at the diversity of
the Type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provided by the main sequence of
quasars. The main sequence permitted to locate of the super Eddington sources
in observational parameter space and to constrain the distinctive} physical
conditions of their line-emitting BLR. This feat will eventually allow us to
use the fascinating super Eddington quasars as probes to understand better the
cosmological state of our Universe.
