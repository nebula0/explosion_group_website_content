 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) around super massive black holes (SMBHs) are a
potential laboratory to study super-Eddington accretion disks and sometimes
result in powerful jets or outflows which may shine in the radio and sub
millimeter bands. In this work, we model the thermal synchrotron emission of
jets from general relativistic radiation magneto-hydrodynamics (GRRMHD)
simulations of a BH accretion disk/jet system which assumes the TDE resulted in
a magnetized accretion disk around a BH accreting at $\sim 12-25$ times the
Eddington accretion rate. Through synthetic observations with the Next
Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and an image reconstruction
analysis, we demonstrate that TDE jets may provide compelling targets, within
the context of the models explored in this work. In particular, we find that
jets launched by a SANE super-Eddington disk around a spin $a_*=0.9$ reach the
ngEHT detection threshold at large distances (up to 100 Mpc in this work). A
two-temperature plasma in the jet or weaker jets, such as a spin $a_*=0$ model,
requires a much closer distance as we demonstrate detection at 10 Mpc for
limiting cases of $a_*=0,\,\mathcal{R}=1$ or $a_*=0.9,\, \mathcal{R}=20$. We
also demonstrate that TDE jets may appear as superluminal sources if the BH is
rapidly rotating and the jet is viewed nearly face on.
