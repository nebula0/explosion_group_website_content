 We report the detection and interferometric localization of the repeating
fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20220912A during commissioning observations
with the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110). Two bursts were detected from FRB
20220912A, one each on 2022 October 18 and 2022 October 25. The best-fit
position is (R.A. J2000, decl. J2000) = (23:09:04.9, +48:42:25.4), with a 90%
confidence error ellipse of $\pm2$ arcsec and $\pm1$ arcsec in right ascension
and declination respectively. The two bursts have disparate polarization
properties and temporal profiles. We find a Faraday rotation measure that is
consistent with the low value of $+0.6$ rad m$^{-2}$ reported by CHIME/FRB. The
DSA-110 localization overlaps with the galaxy PSO J347.2702+48.7066 at a
redshift $z=0.0771$, which we identify as the likely host. PSO
J347.2702$+$48.7066 has a stellar mass of approximately $10^{10}M_{\odot}$,
modest internal dust extinction, and a star-formation rate likely in excess of
$0.1\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The host-galaxy contribution to the dispersion
measure is likely $\lesssim50$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The FRB 20220912A source is
therefore likely viewed along a tenuous plasma column through the host galaxy.
