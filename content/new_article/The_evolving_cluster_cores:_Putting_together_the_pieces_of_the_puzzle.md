 In this work we address the issue of whether the division of clusters in cool
cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs) is due to a primordial difference or to
how clusters evolve across cosmic time. Our first goal is to establish if
spectra from the central regions of a subclass of NCCs known as cool core
remnants (CCRs) are consistent with having a small but significant amount of
short cooling time gas, thereby allowing a transformation to CC systems on a
timescale of a giga year. Our second goal is to determine if low ionization Fe
lines emitted from this residual cool gas will be detectable by the
calorimeters that will fly on board XRISM and ATHENA. We performed a spectral
analysis of CCR systems with a multi temperature model and, assuming the
different components to be in pressure equilibrium with one another, derived
entropy and cooling time distributions for the X-ray emitting gas. We find that
in most of our systems, the spectral model allows for a fraction of low
entropy, short cooling time gas with a mass that is comparable to the one in CC
systems. Moreover, simulations show that future spectrometers on board XRISM
and ATHENA will have the power to directly resolve emission lines from the low
temperature gas, thereby providing incontrovertible evidence for its presence.
Within the scenario that we have explored, the constant fraction of CCs
measured across cosmic time emerges from a dynamical equilibrium where CCs
transformed in NCCs through mergers are balanced by NCCs that revert to CCs.
Furthermore, CCs and NCCs should not be viewed as distinct sub classes, but as
``states" between which clusters can move.
