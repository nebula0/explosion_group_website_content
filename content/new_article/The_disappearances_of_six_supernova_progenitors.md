 As part of a larger completed Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Snapshot program,
we observed the sites of six nearby core-collapse supernovae (SNe) at high
spatial resolution: SN 2012A, SN 2013ej, SN 2016gkg, SN 2017eaw, SN 2018zd, and
SN 2018aoq. These observations were all conducted at sufficiently late times in
each SN's evolution to demonstrate that the massive-star progenitor candidate
identified in each case in pre-explosion imaging data had indeed vanished and
was therefore most likely the actual progenitor. However, we have determined
for SN 2016gkg that the progenitor candidate was most likely a blend of two
objects: the progenitor, which itself has likely vanished, and another
closely-neighbouring star. We thus provide a revised estimate of that
progenitor's properties: a binary system with a hydrogen-stripped primary star
at explosion with effective temperature ~6300--7900 K, bolometric luminosity
~10^{4.65} L_sun, radius ~118--154 R_sun, and initial mass 9.5--11 M_sun.
Utilising late-time additional archival HST data nearly contemporaneous with
our Snapshots, we also show that SN 2017eaw had a luminous ultraviolet excess,
which is best explained as a result of ongoing interaction of the SN shock with
pre-existing circumstellar matter. We offer the caveat, particularly in the
case of SN 2013ej, that obscuration from SN dust may be compromising our
conclusions. This sample adds to the growing list of confirmed or likely
core-collapse SN progenitors.
