 The collapse of the magnetic rotating protostellar cloud with mass of
$10\,M_{\odot}$ is numerically studied. The initial ratios of the thermal,
magnetic, and rotational energies of the cloud to the modulus of its
gravitational energy are 0.3, 0.2 and 0.01, respectively. The emphasis is on
the evolution and properties of the quasi-magnetostatic primary disk formed at
the isothermal stage of the collapse. Simulations show that the primary disk
size and mass increase during evolution from $1500$ au to $7400$ au and from
$0.3\,M_{\odot}$ to $5.2\,M_{\odot}$, respectively. Magnetic field is
quasi-radial in the cloud envelope and quasi-uniform within the primary disk. A
toroidal magnetic field is generated behind the front of the fast shock MHD
wave propagating from the primary disk boundary and in the region of the
outflow formed near the first hydrostatic core. The hierarchical structure of
collapsing protostellar clouds can be revealed in observations in terms of the
magnetic field geometry and the angular momentum distribution.
