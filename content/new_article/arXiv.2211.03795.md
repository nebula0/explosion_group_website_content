Impulsive supernova feedback and non-standard dark matter models, such as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), are the two main contenders for the role of the dominant core formation mechanism at the dwarf galaxy scale. Here we show that the impulsive supernova cycles that follow episodes of bursty star formation leave distinct features in the distribution function of stars: groups of stars with similar ages and metallicities develop overdense shells in phase space. If cores are formed through supernova feedback, we predict the presence of such features in star-forming dwarf galaxies with cored host halos. Their systematic absence would favor alternative dark matter models, such as SIDM, as the dominant core formation mechanism.
