 General relativity predicts that images of optically thin accretion flows
around black holes should generically have a ``photon ring,'' composed of a
series of increasingly sharp subrings that correspond to increasingly strongly
lensed emission near the black hole. Because the effects of lensing are
determined by the spacetime curvature, the photon ring provides a pathway to
precise measurements of the black hole properties and tests of the Kerr metric.
We explore the prospects for detecting and measuring the photon ring using very
long baseline interferometry (VLBI) with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and
the next generation EHT (ngEHT). We present a series of tests using idealized
self-fits to simple geometrical models and show that the EHT observations in
2017 and 2022 lack the angular resolution and sensitivity to detect the photon
ring, while the improved coverage and angular resolution of ngEHT at 230 GHz
and 345 GHz is sufficient for these models. We then analyze detection prospects
using more realistic images from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations by applying ``hybrid imaging,'' which simultaneously models two
components: a flexible raster image (to capture the direct emission) and a ring
component. Using the Bayesian VLBI modeling package \comrade, we show that the
results of hybrid imaging must be interpreted with extreme caution for both
photon ring detection and measurement -- hybrid imaging readily produces false
positives for a photon ring, and its ring measurements do not directly
correspond to the properties of the photon ring.
