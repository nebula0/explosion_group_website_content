 Reconstructing the initial conditions of the Universe from late-time
observations has the potential to optimally extract cosmological information.
Due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space, a differentiable forward
model is needed for convergence, and recent advances have made it possible to
perform reconstruction with nonlinear models based on galaxy (or halo)
positions. In addition to positions, future surveys will provide measurements
of galaxies' peculiar velocities through the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect (kSZ), type Ia supernovae, and the fundamental plane or Tully-Fisher
relations. Here we develop the formalism for including halo velocities, in
addition to halo positions, to enhance the reconstruction of the initial
conditions. We show that using velocity information can significantly improve
the reconstruction accuracy compared to using only the halo density field. We
study this improvement as a function of shot noise, velocity measurement noise,
and angle to the line of sight. We also show how halo velocity data can be used
to improve the reconstruction of the final nonlinear matter overdensity and
velocity fields. We have built our pipeline into the differentiable
Particle-Mesh FlowPM package, paving the way to perform field-level
cosmological inference with joint velocity and density reconstruction. This is
especially useful given the increased ability to measure peculiar velocities in
the near future.
