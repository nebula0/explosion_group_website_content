 Investigating interstellar (IS) dust properties in external galaxies is
important not only to infer the intrinsic properties of astronomical objects
but also to understand the star/planet formation in the galaxies. From the
non-Milky-Way-like extinction and interstellar polarization (ISP) observed in
reddened Type~Ia supernovae (SNe), it has been suggested that their host
galaxies contain dust grains whose properties are substantially different from
the Milky-Way (MW) dust. It is important to investigate the universality of
such non-MW-like dust in the universe. Here we report spectropolarimetry of two
highly-extinguished Type~II SNe (SN~2022aau and SN~2022ame). SN~2022aau shows a
polarization maximum at a shorter wavelength than MW stars, which is also
observed in some Type~Ia SNe. This is clear evidence for the existence of
non-MW-like dust in its host galaxy (i.e., NGC~1672). This fact implies that
such non-MW-like dust might be more common in some environments than expected,
and thus it might affect the picture of the star/planet formation. On the other
hand, SN~2022ame shows MW-like ISP, implying the presence of MW-like dust in
its host galaxy (i.e., NGC~1255). Our findings confirm that dust properties of
galaxies are diverse, either locally or globally. The present work demonstrates
that further investigation of IS dust properties in external galaxies using
polarimetry of highly-reddened SNe is promising, providing a great opportunity
to study the universality of such non-MW-like dust grains in the universe.
