 I argue that the assumption that the jets that shape the axisymmetrical
morphological features of core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants are post-kick
jets, i.e., the neutron star (NS) launches these jets after the explosion and
after it acquired its natal kick velocity, leads to the conclusion that the
pre-collapse cores of CCSN progenitors have sufficient angular momentum
fluctuations to support jittering jets that explode the star. From the finding
that the shaping-jets neither tend to be aligned with the kick velocity nor to
be perpendicular to it I argue that the assumption that the shaping-jets are
post-kick jets has the following implications. (1) The NS accretes mass at a
radius of r~5000 km from the center of the explosion at ~10 seconds after
explosion. (2) The required angular momentum fluctuations of the accreted gas
to explain the medium values of jets-kick angles are also sufficient to support
an intermittent pre-kick accretion disk, just before and during the explosion.
Such an intermittent accretion disk is likely to launch jets that explode the
star in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism. This suggests that
most likely the shaping-jets are the last jets in the jittering jets explosion
mechanism rather than post-kick jets. (3) The expectation of the jittering jets
explosion mechanism is that black holes have small natal kick velocities.
