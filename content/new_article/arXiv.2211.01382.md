We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=2-3$ in the stellar mass range of $M_\star\approx 10^{6.5}-10^{9.5}M_\odot$ using 55 dwarf galaxies in the Abell 2744 and SMACS J0723-3732 galaxy cluster fields. These dwarf galaxies are identified and confirmed by deep JWST/NIRISS imaging and slitless grism spectroscopic observations. Taking advantage of the gravitational lensing effect, we extend the previous MZR relation at $z=2-3$ to a much lower mass regime by more than 2.5 orders of magnitude compared with previous studies. We find that the MZR has a shallower slope at the low-mass end ($M_\star&lt;10^{9}M_\odot$) compared to that at the high-mass end ($M_\star&gt;10^{9}M_\odot$), with a slope turnover point at around the stellar mass of $10^9 M_\odot$. This implies that dominating feedback processes in dwarf galaxies may be different from that in galaxies with higher mass. From $z=3$ to $z=2$, the metallicity of the dwarf galaxies is enhanced by $\approx0.1$ dex for a given stellar mass, consistent with the mild evolution found in galaxies with higher mass. Further, we confirm the existence of a 3D relation between the gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass, and star formation rate, i.e., fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), in dwarf galaxies at $z=2-3$. Our derived FMR, which has no significant redshift evolution, can be used as a benchmark to understand the origin of the anti-correlation between SFR and metallicity of dwarf galaxies in the high-redshift Universe.
