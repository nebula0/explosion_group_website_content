 Despite the importance of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in
models of galaxy evolution, observational constraints on the influence of AGN
feedback on star formation remain weak. To this end, we have compared the star
formation trends of 279 low-redshift AGN galaxies with 558 non-active control
galaxies using integral field unit spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey.
With a Gaussian process-based methodology, we reconstruct non-parametric star
formation histories in spatially-resolved spaxels covering the face of each
galaxy. Based on galaxy-wide star-formation rates (SFRs) alone, we find no
obvious signatures of AGN feedback. However, the AGN galaxies have
significantly suppressed central (kpc-scale) SFRs, lying up to a factor of $2$
below that of the control galaxies, providing direct observational evidence of
AGN feedback suppressing star formation. The suppression of central SFRs in the
AGN galaxies began in the central regions $\sim 6$ Gyr ago (redshift $z \sim
0.7$), taking place over a few Gyrs. A small subset of the AGN galaxies were
rapidly driven to quiescence shortly before being observed (in the last $500$
Myr), potentially indicating instances of AGN-driven feedback. More frequently,
however, star formation continues in the AGN galaxies, with suppression
primarily in the central regions. This is suggestive of a picture in which
integrated (Gyr-timescale) AGN feedback can significantly affect central star
formation, but may be inefficient in driving galaxy-wide quenching in
low-redshift galaxies, instead leaving them in the green valley.
