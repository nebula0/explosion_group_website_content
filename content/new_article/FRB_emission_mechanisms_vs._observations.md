 Presently, it is broadly assumed that fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sources of
coherent emission powered by the magnetic energy release in magnetars. However,
the exact emission mechanism is not known, yet. Two main frameworks exist:
magnetospheric emission and radiation from external relativistic shocks. In
this brief review, I describe basics of both approaches and discuss how they
are probed by modern observations.
