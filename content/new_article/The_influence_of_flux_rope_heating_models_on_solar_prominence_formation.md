 Aims. We begin by exploring the influence of two classes of commonly adopted
heating models on the formation behaviour of solar prominences. These models
consider either an exponential variation dependent on height alone, or local
density and magnetic field conditions. We highlight and address some of the
limitations inherent to these early approximations by proposing a new, dynamic
2D flux rope heating model that qualitatively accounts for the 3D topology of
the twisted flux rope field. Methods. We performed 2.5D grid-adaptive numerical
simulations of prominence formation via the levitation-condensation mechanism.
A linear force-free arcade is subjected to shearing and converging motions,
leading to the formation of a flux rope containing material that may succumb to
thermal instability. The eventual formation and subsequent evolution of
prominence condensations was then quantified as a function of the specific
background heating prescription adopted. For the simulations that consider the
topology of the flux rope, reduced heating was considered within a dynamically
evolving ellipse that traces the flux rope cross-section. This ellipse is
centred on the flux rope axis and tracked during runtime using an approach
based on the instantaneous magnetic field curvature. Results. We find that the
nature of the heating model is clearly imprinted on the evolution and
morphology of any resulting prominences: one large, low-altitude condensation
is obtained for the heating model based on local parameters, while the
exponential model leads to the additional formation of smaller blobs throughout
the flux rope which then relocate as they tend towards achieving hydrostatic
equilibrium. Finally, a study of the condensation process in phase space
reveals a non-isobaric evolution with an eventual recovery of uniform pressure
balance along flux surfaces.
