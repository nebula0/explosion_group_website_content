 We present and analyze a series of synthetic galaxy survey fields based on
the IllustrisTNG Simulation suite. With the Illustris public data release and
JupyterLab service, we generated a set of twelve lightcone catalogs covering
areas from 5 to 365 square arcminutes, similar to several JWST Cycle 1
programs, including JADES, CEERS, PRIMER, and NGDEEP. From these catalogs, we
queried the public API to generate simple mock images in a series of broadband
filters used by JWST-NIRCam and the Hubble Space Telescope cameras. This
procedure generates wide-area simulated mosaic images that can support
investigating the predicted evolution of galaxies alongside real data. Using
these mocks, we demonstrate a few simple science cases, including morphological
evolution and close pair selection. We publicly release the catalogs and mock
images through MAST, along with the code used to generate these projects, so
that the astrophysics community can make use of these products in their
scientific analyses of JWST deep field observations.
