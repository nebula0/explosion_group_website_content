 Partial dust obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been proposed as
a potential explanation for some cases of AGN variability. The dust-gas mixture
present in AGN torii is accelerated by radiation pressure leading to the
launching of an AGN wind. Dust under these conditions has been shown to be
unstable to a generic class of fast growing resonant drag instabilities (RDIs).
We present the first set of numerical simulations of radiation driven outflows
that include explicit dust dynamics in conditions resembling AGN winds and
discuss the implications of the RDIs on the morphology of the AGN torus, AGN
variability, and the ability of the radiation to effectively launch a wind. We
find that the RDIs rapidly develop reaching saturation at times much shorter
than the global timescales of the outflows, resulting in the formation of
filamentary structure on box-size scales with strong dust clumping and
super-Alfv\'enic velocity dispersions on micro-scales. This results in 10-20%
fluctuations in dust opacity and gas column density, integrated along mock
observed lines-of-sight to the quasar accretion disk, over year to decade
timescales with a red-noise power spectrum which is commonly observed for AGN.
Additionally, all our simulations show that the radiation is sufficiently
coupled to the dust-gas mixture launching highly super-sonic winds, which
entrain 70-90% of gas, with a factor of $\lesssim 3$ photon momentum loss
relative to the ideal case. Therefore, the RDIs could play an important role in
generating the clumpy nature of AGN torii and driving AGN variability
consistent with observations.
