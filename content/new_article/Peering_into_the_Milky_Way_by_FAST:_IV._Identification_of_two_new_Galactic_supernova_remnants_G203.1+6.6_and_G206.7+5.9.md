 A $5^{\circ} \times 7^{\circ}$ sky area containing two large radio structures
of G203.1+6.6 and G206.7+5.9 with a size of about 2.5$^{\circ}$ and
3.5$^{\circ}$ respectively is scanned by using the L-band 19-beam receiver of
the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The FAST
L-band receiver covers a frequency range of 1.0 GHz $-$ 1.5 GHz. Commissioning
of the receiving system, including the measurements of the half-power beam
width, gain, and main-beam efficiency is made by observing the calibrators. The
multi-channel spectroscopy backend mounted to the receiver allows an in-band
spectral-index determination. The brightness-temperature spectral indices of
both objects are measured to be $\beta \sim$ $-$2.6 to $-$2.7. Polarized
emission is detected from the archival Effelsberg $\lambda$11 cm data for all
the shell structures of G203.1+6.6 and G206.7+5.9. These results clearly
indicate a non-thermal synchrotron emitting nature, confirming that G203.1+6.6
and G206.7+5.9 are large shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs). Based on
morphological correlation between the radio continuum emission of G206.7+5.9
and the HI structures, the kinematic distance to this new SNR is estimated to
be about 440 pc, placing it in the Local Arm.
