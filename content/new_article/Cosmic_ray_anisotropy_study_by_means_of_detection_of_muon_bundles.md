 In this work, we use muon bundles which are formed in extensive air showers
and detected at the ground level as a tool for searching anisotropy of high
energy cosmic rays. Such choice is explained by the penetrating ability of
muons which allows them to retain the direction of primary particles with a
good accuracy. In 2012-2022, we performed long-term muon bundle detection with
the coordinate-tracking detector DECOR, which is a part of the Experimental
complex NEVOD (MEPhI, Moscow). To search for the cosmic rays anisotropy, the
muon bundles arriving at zenith angles in the range from 15 to 75 degrees in
the local coordinate system are used. During the entire period of data taking,
about 14 million of such events have been accumulated. In this paper, we
describe some methods developed in the Experimental complex NEVOD and
implemented in our research, including: the method for compensating the
influence of meteorological conditions on the intensity of muon bundles at the
Earth's surface, the method for accounting the design features of the detector
and the inhomogeneity of the detection efficiency for different directions, as
well as the method for estimating primary energies of cosmic rays. Here we
present the results of the search for the dipole anisotropy of cosmic rays with
energies in the PeV region and also compare them with the results obtained at
the other scientific facilities.
