 This paper analyse the properties of minimal solutions for the reconstruction
of the lens potential in the singular perturbative approach. These minimal
solutions corresponds to an expansion with a minimal degree in Fourier
expansion of the perturbative fields. Using these minimal solutions prevent
spurious physically meaningless terms in the reconstruction of the fields. In
effect a perturbative analysis indicates that a small change in the source
model will corresponds to the higher order terms in the expansion of the
fields. The results of the perturbative analysis are valid not only for
slightly non-circular sources but also for more distorted sources to order two.
It is thus of crucial importance to minimize the number of terms used in the
modelling of the lens. Another important asset of the minimal solutions is that
they offers a de-coupling between the source and lens model and thus help to
break the source lens degeneracy issue. The possible drawback of minimal
solutions is to under-estimate the higher order terms in the solution. However
this bias has its merit since the detection of higher order terms using this
method will ensure that these terms are real. This type of analysis using
minimal solutions will be of particular interest when considering the
statistical analysis of a large number of lenses, especially in light of the
incoming satellite surveys.
