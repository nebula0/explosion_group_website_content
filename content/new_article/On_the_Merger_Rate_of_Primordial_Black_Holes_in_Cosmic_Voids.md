 Cosmic voids are known as underdense substructures of the cosmic web that
cover a large volume of the Universe. It is known that cosmic voids contain a
small number of dark matter halos, so the existence of primordial black holes
(PBHs) in these secluded regions of the Universe is not unlikely. In this work,
we calculate the merger rate of PBHs in dark matter halos structured in cosmic
voids and determine their contribution to gravitational wave events resulting
from black hole mergers recorded by the Advanced Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO)-Advanced Virgo (aVirgo) detectors.
Relying on the PBH scenario, the results of our analysis indicate that about $2
\sim 3$ annual events of binary black hole mergers out of all those recorded by
the aLIGO-aVirgo detectors should belong to cosmic voids. We also calculate the
redshift evolution of the merger rate of PBHs in cosmic voids. The results show
that the evolution of the merger rate of PBHs has minimum sensitivity to the
redshift changes, which seems reasonable while considering the evolution of
cosmic voids. Finally, we specify the behavior of the merger rate of PBHs as a
function of their mass and fraction in cosmic voids and we estimate
$\mathcal{R} (M_{PBH}, f_{PBH})$ relation, which is well compatible with our
findings.
