 We study a model of inflation with multiple pseudo-scalar fields coupled to a
$U(1)$ gauge field through Chern-Simons interactions. Because of parity
violating interactions, one polarization of the gauge field is amplified
yielding to enhanced curvature perturbation power spectrum. Inflation proceeds
in multiple stages as each pseudo-scalar field rolls towards its minimum
yielding to distinct multiple peaks in the curvature perturbations power
spectrum at various scales during inflation. The localized peaks in power
spectrum generate Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) which can furnish a large
fraction of Dark Matter (DM) abundance. In addition, gravitational waves (GWs)
with non-trivial spectra are generated which are in sensitivity range of
various forthcoming GW observatories.
