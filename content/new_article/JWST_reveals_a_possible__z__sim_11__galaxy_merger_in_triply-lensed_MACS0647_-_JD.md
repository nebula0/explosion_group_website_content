 MACS0647$-$JD is a triply-lensed $z\sim11$ galaxy originally discovered with
the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we report new JWST imaging, which clearly
resolves MACS0647$-$JD as having two components that are either merging
galaxies or stellar complexes within a single galaxy. Both are very small, with
stellar masses $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ and radii $r<100\,\rm pc$. The brighter
larger component "A" is intrinsically very blue ($\beta\sim-2.6$), likely due
to very recent star formation and no dust, and is spatially extended with an
effective radius $\sim70\,\rm pc$. The smaller component "B" appears redder
($\beta\sim-2$), likely because it is older ($100-200\,\rm Myr$) with mild dust
extinction ($A_V\sim0.1\,\rm mag$), and a smaller radius $\sim20\,\rm pc$. We
identify galaxies with similar colors in a high-redshift simulation, finding
their star formation histories to be out of phase. With an estimated stellar
mass ratio of roughly 2:1 and physical projected separation $\sim400\,\rm pc$,
we may be witnessing a galaxy merger 400 million years after the Big Bang. We
also identify a candidate companion galaxy C $\sim3\,{\rm kpc}$ away, likely
destined to merge with galaxies A and B. The combined light from galaxies A+B
is magnified by factors of $\sim$8, 5, and 2 in three lensed images JD1, 2, and
3 with F356W fluxes $\sim322$, $203$, $86\,\rm nJy$ (AB mag 25.1, 25.6, 26.6).
MACS0647$-$JD is significantly brighter than other galaxies recently discovered
at similar redshifts with JWST. Without magnification, it would have AB mag
27.3 ($M_{UV}=-20.4$). With a high confidence level, we obtain a photometric
redshift of $z=10.6\pm0.3$ based on photometry measured in 6 NIRCam filters
spanning $1-5\rm\mu m$, out to $4300\,\r{A}$ rest-frame. JWST NIRSpec
observations planned for January 2023 will deliver a spectroscopic redshift and
a more detailed study of the physical properties of MACS0647$-$JD.
