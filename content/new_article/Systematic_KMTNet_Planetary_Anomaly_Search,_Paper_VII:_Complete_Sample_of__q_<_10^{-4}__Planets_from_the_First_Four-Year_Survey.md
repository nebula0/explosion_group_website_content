 We present the analysis of seven microlensing planetary events with
planet/host mass ratios $q < 10^{-4}$: KMT-2017-BLG-1194, KMT-2017-BLG-0428,
KMT-2019-BLG-1806, KMT-2017-BLG-1003, KMT-2019-BLG-1367, OGLE-2017-BLG-1806,
and KMT-2016-BLG-1105. They were identified by applying the Korea Microlensing
Telescope Network (KMTNet) AnomalyFinder algorithm to 2016--2019 KMTNet events.
A Bayesian analysis indicates that all the lens systems consist of a cold
super-Earth orbiting an M or K dwarf. Together with 17 previously published and
three that will be published elsewhere, AnomalyFinder has found a total of 27
planets that have solutions with $q < 10^{-4}$ from 2016--2019 KMTNet events,
which lays the foundation for the first statistical analysis of the planetary
mass-ratio function based on KMTNet data. By reviewing the 27 planets, we find
that the missing planetary caustics problem in the KMTNet planetary sample has
been solved by AnomalyFinder. We also find a desert of high-magnification
planetary signals ($A \gtrsim 65$), and a follow-up project for KMTNet
high-magnification events could detect at least two more $q < 10^{-4}$ planets
per year and form an independent statistical sample.
