 Molecular line observations are powerful tracers of the physical and chemical
conditions across the different evolutionary stages of star, disk and planet
formation. Using the high angular resolution and unprecedented sensitivity of
the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) there is now a drive to detect
small-scale gas structures in protoplanetary disks that can be attributed
directly to forming planets. We report high angular resolution ALMA Band 7
observations of sulphur monoxide (SO) in the nearby planet-hosting disk around
Herbig star HD 100546. SO is rarely detected in evolved protoplanetary disks
but in other environments, it is most often utilised as a tracer of shocks. The
SO emission from the HD 100546 disk is primarily originating from gas within
the approx. 20 au mm-dust cavity and shows a clear azimuthal brightness
asymmetry of a factor of 2. In addition, we see a significant difference in the
line profile shape when comparing these new Cycle 7 data to Cycle 0 data of the
same SO transitions. We discuss the different physical/chemical mechanisms that
could be responsible for this asymmetry and time variability including disk
winds, disk warps, and a shock triggered by a (forming) planet. We propose that
the SO is enhanced in the cavity due to the presence of a giant planet. The SO
asymmetry complements evidence for hot circumplanetary material around the
giant planet HD 100546 c traced via CO ro-vibrational emission. This work sets
the stage for further observational and modelling efforts to detect and
understand the chemical imprint of a forming planet on its parent disk.
