 Disc galaxies commonly show asymmetric features in their morphology, such as
warps and lopsidedness. These features can provide key information regarding
the recent evolution of a given disc galaxy. In the nearby Universe, up to ~30
percent of late-type galaxies display a global non-axisymmetric lopsided mass
distribution, but little attention has been paid to the origin of this
perturbation. In this work, we study the origin of lopsided perturbations in
simulated disc galaxies extracted from the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG
project. We statistically explore different excitation mechanisms for this
perturbation, such as direct satellite tidal interactions and distortions of
the underlying dark matter distributions. We also characterize the main
physical conditions that lead to lopsided perturbations. 50 percent of our
sample galaxy have lopsided modes $m=1$ greater than ~0.12. We find a strong
correlation between internal galaxy properties, such as central stellar surface
density and disc radial extension with the strength of lopsided modes. The
majority of lopsided galaxies have lower central surface densities and more
extended discs than symmetric galaxies. As a result, such lopsided galaxies are
less self-gravitationally cohesive, and their outer disc region is more
susceptible to different types of external perturbations. However, we do not
find strong evidence that tidal interactions with satellite galaxies are the
main driving agent of lopsided modes. Lopsided galaxies tend to live in
asymmetric dark matter halos with high spin, indicating strong galaxy-halo
connections in late-type lopsided galaxies.
