 Electron-positron pair production is the essential process for high-energy
gamma-ray astrophysical observations. Following the pioneering OSO-3 counter
telescope, the field evolved into use of particle tracking instruments, largely
derived from high-energy physics detectors. Although many of the techniques
were developed on balloon-borne gamma-ray telescopes, the need to escape the
high background in the atmosphere meant that the breakthrough discoveries came
from the SAS-2 and COS-B satellites. The next major pair production success was
EGRET on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, which provided the first all-sky
map at energies above 100 MeV and found a variety of gamma-ray sources, many of
which were variable. The current generation of pair production telescopes,
AGILE and Fermi LAT, have broadened high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics with
particular emphasis on multiwavelength and multimessenger studies. A variety of
options remain open for future missions based on pair production with improved
instrumental performance.
