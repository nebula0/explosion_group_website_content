 We introduce the first complete non-parametric model for the astrophysical
distribution of the binary black hole (BBH) population. Constructed from basis
splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven
investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting
non-parametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment,
and redshift distributions for the first time. Using the BBHs in GWTC-3, we
report the same features recovered with similarly flexible models of the mass
distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of
${\sim}10\,M_\odot$ and ${\sim}35\,M_\odot$. We find a suppressed merger rate
at low primary masses and a mass ratio distribution consistent with a power
law. The distribution for primary spin misalignments we infer peaks away from
alignment, while the magnitude distribution exhibits broad agreement with
previous inferences: the majority of BBH spins are small ($a<0.5$), the
distribution peaks at $a\sim0.2$, and there is mild support for a non-spinning
subpopulation, which may be resolved with larger catalogs. With a modulated
power law describing the BBH merger rate's evolution in redshift, we see hints
of the rate evolution either flattening or decreasing at $z\sim0.2-0.5$, but
the full distribution remains entirely consistent with a monotonically
increasing power law. We conclude with a discussion of the astrophysical
context of our new findings and how non-parametric methods in
gravitational-wave population inference are uniquely poised to complement to
the parametric approach as we enter the data-rich era of gravitational-wave
astronomy.
