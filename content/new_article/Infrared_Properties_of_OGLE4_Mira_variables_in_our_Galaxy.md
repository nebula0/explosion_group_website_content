 We investigate infrared properties of OGLE4 Mira variables in our Galaxy. For
each object, we cross-identify the WISE, 2MASS, and IRAS counterparts. We
present various IR two-color diagrams (2CDs) and period-magnitude and
period-color relations for the Mira variables. Generally, the Miras variables
with longer periods are brighter in the IR fluxes and redder in the IR colors.
In this work, we also revise and update the previous catalog of AGB stars in
our Galaxy using the new sample of OGLE4 Mira variables. Now, we present a new
catalog of 74,093 (64,609 O-rich and 9484 C-rich) AGB stars in our Galaxy. A
group of 23,314 (19,196 O-rich and 4118 C-rich) AGB stars are identified based
on the IRAS PSC and another group of 50,779 (45,413 O-rich and 5366 C-rich) AGB
stars are identified based on the AllWISE source catalog. For all of the AGB
stars, we cross-identify the IRAS, AKARI, MSX, AllWISE, 2MASS, OGLE4, Gaia, and
AAVSO counterparts and present various infrared 2CDs. Comparing the
observations with the theory, we find that basic theoretical dust shell models
can account for the IR observations fairly well for most of the AGB stars.
