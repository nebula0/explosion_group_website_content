 This paper presents a polarization calibration method applied to a microwave
polarimeter demonstrator based on a near-infrared (NIR) frequency up-conversion
stage that allows both optical correlation and signal detection at a wavelength
of 1550 nm. The instrument was designed to measure the polarization of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation from the sky, obtaining the Stokes
parameters of the incoming signal simultaneously, in a frequency range from 10
to 20 GHz. A linearly polarized input signal with a variable polarization angle
is used as excitation in the polarimeter calibration setup mounted in the
laboratory. The polarimeter systematic errors can be corrected with the
proposed calibration procedure, achieving high levels of polarization
efficiency (low polarization percentage errors) and low polarization angle
errors. The calibration method is based on the fitting of polarization errors
by means of sinusoidal functions composed of additive or multiplicative terms.
The accuracy of the fitting increases with the number of terms in such a way
that the typical error levels required in low-frequency CMB experiments can be
achieved with only a few terms in the fitting functions. On the other hand,
assuming that the calibration signal is known with the required accuracy,
additional terms can be calculated to reach the error levels needed in
ultrasensitive B-mode polarization CMB experiments.
