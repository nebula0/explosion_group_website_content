 The growth of a longitudinal or quasi-longitudinal Langmuir mode in the
outward-moving beam of ions and protons that forms the open sector of an
ion-proton pulsar magnetosphere radiates as an analogue of an end-fed
high-impedance horizontal straight-wire antenna an integral number of
half-waves in length. The radiation has, broadly, the energy flux, linear
polarization and spectral index that are widely observed: also, the notch
phenomenon seen in some integrated pulse profiles occurs naturally. The new
field of pulsar observations below 100 MHz may lead to productive tests of the
radio emission mechanism.
