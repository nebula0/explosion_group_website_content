 This paper represents an effort to provide robust constraints on cosmology
and the galaxy-halo connection using a fully numerical model of small-scale
galaxy clustering. We explore two extensions to the standard Halo Occupation
Distribution model: assembly bias, whereby halo occupation depends on both halo
mass and the larger environment, and velocity bias, whereby galaxy velocities
do not perfectly trace the velocity of the dark matter within the halo.
Moreover, we incorporate halo mass corrections to account for the impact of
baryonic physics on the halo population. We identify an optimal set of
clustering measurements to constrain this "decorated" HOD model for both low-
and high-luminosity galaxies in SDSS DR7. We find that, for low-luminosity
galaxies, a model with both assembly bias and velocity bias provides the best
fit to the clustering measurements, with no tension remaining in the fit. In
this model we find evidence for both central and satellite galaxy assembly bias
at the 99% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. In addition, we find
evidence for satellite galaxy velocity bias at the 99.9% confidence level. For
high luminosity galaxies, we find no evidence for either assembly bias or
velocity bias, but our model exhibits significant tension with SDSS
measurements. We find that all of these conclusions still stand when we include
the effects of baryonic physics on the halo mass function, suggesting that the
tension we find for high luminosity galaxies may be due to a problem with our
assumed cosmological model.
