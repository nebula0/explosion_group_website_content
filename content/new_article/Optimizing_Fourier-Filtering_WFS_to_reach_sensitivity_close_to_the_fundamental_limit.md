 To reach the full potential of the new generation of ground based telescopes,
an extremely fine adjustment of the phase is required. Wavefront control and
correction before detection has therefore become one of the cornerstones of
instruments to achieve targeted performance, especially for high-contrast
imaging. A crucial feature of accurate wavefront control leans on the wavefront
sensor (WFS). We present a strategy to design new Fourier-Filtering WFS that
encode the phase close from the fundamental photon efficiency limit. This
strategy seems promising as it generates highly sensitive sensors suited for
different pupil shape configurations.
