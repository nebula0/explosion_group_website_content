 Jet re-orientation associated with the time evolution of radio quasars
explains the formation of X-shaped radio galaxies and their preference for
isolated environments. But since X-shaped radio galaxies are generally not
found in dense environments (e.g. groups/clusters), the jet re-orientation
phenomenon for radio galaxies in groups and clusters has been ignored. We take
a closer look at the re-orientation of FRI jets with respect to FRII jets, and
find that it may constitute the as-yet unidentified trigger for star formation
suppression in radio galaxies. We show how the recently explored radio "red
geyser" galaxies can be interpreted in this context and ultimately reveal a
deeper understanding of why FRII radio galaxies are on one side of the star
formation enhancement/suppression divide compared to FRI radio galaxies.
