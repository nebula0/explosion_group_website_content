 We present the first cosmological constraints derived from the analysis of
the void size function. This work relies on the final BOSS DR12 data set, a
large spectroscopic galaxy catalog, ideal for the identification of cosmic
voids. We extract a sample of voids from the distribution of galaxies and we
apply a cleaning procedure aimed at reaching high levels of purity and
completeness. We model the void size function by means of an extension of the
popular volume-conserving model, based on two additional nuisance parameters.
Relying on mock catalogs specifically designed to reproduce the BOSS DR12
galaxy sample, we calibrate the extended size function model parameters and
validate the methodology. We then apply a Bayesian analysis to constrain the
$\Lambda$CDM model and one of its simplest extensions, featuring a constant
dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$. Following a conservative
approach, we put constraints on the total matter density parameter and the
amplitude of density fluctuations, finding $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.29^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ and $\sigma_8=0.80^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$. Testing the
alternative scenario, we derive $w=-1.1\pm 0.3$, in agreement with the
$\Lambda$CDM model. These results are independent and complementary to those
derived from standard cosmological probes, opening up new ways to identify the
origin of potential tensions in the current cosmological paradigm.
