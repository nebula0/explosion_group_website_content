 We aim to investigate the AGN/ICM interplay in ZwCl 235, a galaxy cluster
with high X-ray flux, an extended central radio galaxy, and evidence of
multi-phase gas at its center. Using archival data from the Chandra telescope,
the VLASS survey, the LOTSS survey and the VLBA telescope, we perform a
complete study of ZwCl 235, dissecting the dynamics of the ICM, the
thermodynamic state of the central gas, and the properties of the BCG. By means
of radial profiles and 2D spectral maps, we measure the temperature, entropy
and cooling time of the ICM, and we compare the morphology of the central radio
galaxy with the surrounding medium. We find evidence that ZwCl 235 is a
sloshing cool core cluster in which the activity of the central galaxy has
excavated a pair of cavities and possibly uplifted enriched gas to an altitude
of ~30 kpc. In the cluster core, the lowest entropy ICM is preferentially found
in a 20 kpc-long filament tangential to the southern radio lobe of the AGN. We
argue that the observed cool (~1.3 keV) filament is likely produced by a
combination of sloshing and stimulated ICM cooling, that may be fueling the
central supermassive black hole. Additionally, we determine that the X-ray
emission of the BCG originates from a ~1.4 keV plasma kernel which extends for
5 kpc in radius and has a short cooling time (~240 Myr), and could represent
the thermal corona of the BCG. Overall, we propose that several sources (the
large scale ICM, the low entropy filament and the ~1.4 keV kernel) of cold
material are currently feeding the central AGN, and that the ICM cooling cycle
expectations are met from the macro scales (between 5 - 100 kpc) to the meso
scales (<5 kpc) of AGN feedback.
