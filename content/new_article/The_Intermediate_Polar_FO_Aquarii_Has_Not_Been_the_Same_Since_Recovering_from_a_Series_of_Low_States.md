 FO Aqr is a bright intermediate polar that has long displayed large amplitude
photometric variations corresponding to the 20.9 min spin period of its white
dwarf. Between 2016 and 2020, the system suffered a series of unprecedented
low-states, but recent data shows that it has now recovered to its normal
optical luminosity. We compare the light curves obtained by K2/Kepler in 2014
with photometry from the TESS mission obtained in 2021. We find that the spin
pulse that had been the dominant feature of the light curve in 2014 is now weak
over the second half the binary orbit and that a beat pulse is enhanced in the
TESS photometry. Variations at approximately twice the spin frequency are now
seen over the second half of the orbit. These photometric properties may be the
new normal for FO Aqr now that its white dwarf has begun to spin down.
