 HERMES-Pathfinder is a constellation of six 3U nano-satellites hosting simple
but innovative X-ray detectors for determining the positions of, and monitoring
cosmic high-energy transients such as gamma-ray bursts and the electromagnetic
counterparts of gravitational Wave Events. The HERMES Technological Pathfinder
project is funded by the Italian Space Agency, while the HERMES Scientific
Pathfinder project is funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and
Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 821896. HERMES-Pathfinder is an
in-orbit demonstration, that should be tested in orbit starting in 2023. We
present the main scientific goals of HERMES-Pathfinder, as well as a
description of the HERMES-Pathfinder payload and performance.
