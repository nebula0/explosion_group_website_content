 We present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the morphological and
structural properties of a large sample of galaxies at z=3-9 using early JWST
CEERS NIRCam observations. Our sample consists of 850 galaxies at z>3 detected
in both CANDELS HST imaging and JWST CEERS NIRCam images to enable a comparison
of HST and JWST morphologies. Our team conducted a set of visual
classifications, with each galaxy in the sample classified by three different
individuals. We also measure quantitative morphologies using the publicly
available codes across all seven NIRCam filters. Using these measurements, we
present the fraction of galaxies of each morphological type as a function of
redshift. Overall, we find that galaxies at z>3 have a wide diversity of
morphologies. Galaxies with disks make up a total of 60\% of galaxies at z=3
and this fraction drops to ~30% at z=6-9, while galaxies with spheroids make up
~30-40% across the whole redshift range and pure spheroids with no evidence for
disks or irregular features make up ~20%. The fraction of galaxies with
irregular features is roughly constant at all redshifts (~40-50%), while those
that are purely irregular increases from ~12% to ~20% at z>4.5. We note that
these are apparent fractions as many selection effects impact the visibility of
morphological features at high redshift. The distributions of S\'ersic index,
size, and axis ratios show significant differences between the morphological
groups. Spheroid Only galaxies have a higher S\'ersic index, smaller size, and
higher axis ratio than Disk/Irregular galaxies. Across all redshifts, smaller
spheroid and disk galaxies tend to be rounder. Overall, these trends suggest
that galaxies with established disks and spheroids exist across the full
redshift range of this study and further work with large samples at higher
redshift is needed to quantify when these features first formed.
