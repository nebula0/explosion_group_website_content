 The presence of phosphine (PH$_3$) in the atmosphere of Venus was reported by
Greaves et al. (2021a), based on observations of the J=1-0 transition at 267
GHz using ground-based, millimeter-wave spectroscopy. This unexpected discovery
presents a challenge for our understanding of Venus's atmosphere, and has led
to a reappraisal of the possible sources and sinks of atmospheric
phosphorous-bearing gases. Here we present results from a search for PH$_3$ on
Venus using the GREAT instrument aboard the SOFIA aircraft, over three flights
conducted in November 2021. Multiple PH$_3$ transitions were targeted at
frequencies centered on 533 GHz and 1067 GHz, but no evidence for atmospheric
PH$_3$ was detected. Through radiative transfer modeling, we derived a
disk-averaged upper limit on the PH$_3$ abundance of 0.8 ppb in the altitude
range 75-110 km, which is more stringent than previous ground-based studies.
