 We explore the effects of the 2029 Earth encounter on asteroid (99942)
Apophis' non-principal axis spin state, leveraging refined orbit, spin state,
and inertia information provided by more recent optical and radar observations.
Propagating the asteroids' coupled orbit and rigid body attitude dynamics
through the flyby, we present the range of possible post-flyby spin states.
These spin state distributions will be valuable for planning Apophis
observation campaigns and spacecraft missions, most notably OSIRIS-APEX. The
simulations indicate that gravitationally induced changes to the asteroid's
tumbling periods and rotational angular momentum direction (pole) will likely
be significant and measurable. For the current spin state and inertia estimates
and their uncertainties, Apophis is likely to remain in a short axis mode (SAM)
tumbling state but its effective spin rate could halve or double. Its pole is
likely to shift by 10 degrees or more and increase in longitude while moving
closer to the ecliptic plane. These spin state changes are very sensitive to
the asteroid's close approach attitude and mass distribution. With ground-based
tracking of the asteroid's spin state through the encounter, this sensitivity
will help refine mass distribution knowledge. We also discuss the implications
of this abrupt spin state alteration for Apophis' Yarkovsky acceleration and
geophysical properties, identifying possible pathways for surface and internal
changes, most notably if Apophis is a contact binary. Comparison of the pre and
post-flyby inertia estimates obtained from the ground-based observations will
help assess the extent of possible geophysical changes.
