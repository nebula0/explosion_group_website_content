 Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides a potential new probe
of dark matter structures. In this work, we consider the microlensing effect on
gravitational wave signals from black hole binaries induced by low-mass dark
matter halos that do not retain enough baryonic matter to hold stars. We
clarify systematically when this microlensing effect is relevant and study in
detail its detectability by future gravitational wave observatories. We
consider lensing by cold dark matter halos and by solitonic cores that reside
in fuzzy dark matter halos. Our results show that although the effect can be
detectable at relatively large impact parameters, the probability of detecting
such lensed events is low. In particular, we find that the expected number of
events lensed by cold dark matter halos is $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ per year for BBO
and the expected number of events lensed by solitonic cores inside fuzzy dark
matter halos is $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ per year for ET. In the case that a
significant fraction of dark matter consists of $\mathcal{O}(100 M_\odot)$
objects that are relatively compact, $R < \mathcal{O}(0.1\,{\rm pc})$, we show
that the expected number of lensed events per year ET can be very large,
$\mathcal{O}(1000)$.
