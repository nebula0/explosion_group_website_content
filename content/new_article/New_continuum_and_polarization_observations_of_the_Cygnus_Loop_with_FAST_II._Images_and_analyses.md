 We present total-intensity and polarized-intensity images of the Cygnus Loop
supernova remnant (SNR) observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical
radio Telescope (FAST). The high angular-resolution and high-sensitivity images
enable us to thoroughly compare the properties of the northern part with the
southern part of the SNR. The central filament in the northern part and the
southern part have a similar foreground rotation measure, meaning their
distances are likely similar. The polarization analysis indicates that the
random magnetic field is larger than the regular field in the northern part,
but negligible in the southern part. The total-intensity image is decomposed
into components of various angular scales, and the brightness-temperature
spectral index of the shell structures in the northern part is similar to that
in the southern part in the component images. All these evidence suggest that
the northern and southern part of the Cygnus Loop are situated and thus evolved
in different environments of interstellar medium, while belonging to the same
SNR.
