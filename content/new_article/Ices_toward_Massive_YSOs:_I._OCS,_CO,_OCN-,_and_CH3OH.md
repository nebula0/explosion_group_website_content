 An important tracer of the origin and evolution of cometary ices is the
comparison with ices found in dense clouds and towards Young Stellar Objects
(YSOs). We present a survey of ices in the 2-5 micron spectra of 23 massive
YSOs, taken with the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility SpeX spectrometer. The
4.90 micron absorption band of OCS ice is detected in 20 sight-lines, more than
five times the previously known detections. The absorption profile shows little
variation and is consistent with OCS being embedded in CH3OH-rich ices, or
proton-irradiated H2S or SO2-containing ices. The OCS column densities
correlate well with those of CH3OH and OCN-, but not with H2O and apolar CO
ice. This association of OCS with CH3OH and OCN- firmly establishes their
formation location deep inside dense clouds or protostellar envelopes. The
median composition of this ice phase towards massive YSOs, as a percentage of
H2O, is CO:CH3OH:OCN-:OCS=24:20:1.53:0.15. CS, due to its low abundance, is
likely not the main precursor to OCS. Sulfurization of CO is likely needed,
although the source of this sulfur is not well constrained. Compared to massive
YSOs, low mass YSOs and dense clouds have similar CO and CH3OH ice abundances,
but less OCN- and more apolar CO, while OCS awaits detection. Comets tend to be
under-abundant in carbon-bearing species, but this does not appear to be the
case for OCS, perhaps signalling OCS production in protoplanetary disks.
