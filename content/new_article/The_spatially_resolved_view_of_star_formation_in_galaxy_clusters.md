 Integral field spectroscopic studies of galaxies in dense environments, such
as clusters and groups of galaxies, have provided new insights for
understanding how star formation proceeds, and quenches. I present the
spatially resolved view of the star formation activity and its link with the
multiphase gas in cluster galaxies based on MUSE and multi-wavelength data of
the GASP survey. I discuss the link among the different scales (i.e. the link
between the spatially resolved and the global star formation rate-stellar mass
relation), the spatially resolved signatures and the quenching histories of
jellyfish (progenitors) and post-starburst (descendants) galaxies in clusters.
Finally, I discuss the multi-wavelength view of star-forming clumps both in
galaxy disks and in the tails of stripped gas.
