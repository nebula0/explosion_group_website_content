We compare 500~pc scale, resolved observations of ionised and molecular gas for the $z\sim0.02$ starbursting disk galaxy IRAS08339+6517, using measurements from KCWI and NOEMA. We explore the relationship of the star formation driven ionised gas outflows with colocated galaxy properties. We find a roughly linear relationship between the outflow mass flux ($\dotΣ_{\rm out}$) and star formation rate surface density ($Σ_{\rm SFR}$), $\dotΣ_{\rm out}\proptoΣ_{\rm SFR}^{1.06\pm0.10}$, and a strong correlation between $\dotΣ_{\rm out}$ and the gas depletion time, such that $\dotΣ_{\rm out} \propto t_{dep}^{-1.1\pm0.06}$. Moreover, we find these outflows are so-called "breakout"; outflows, according to the relationship between the gas fraction and disk kinematics. Assuming that ionised outflow mass scales with total outflow mass, our observations suggest that the regions of highest $Σ_{\rm SFR}$ in IRAS08 are removing more gas via the outflow than through the conversion of gas into stars. Our results are consistent with a picture in which the outflow limits the ability for a region of a disk to maintain short depletion times. Our results underline the need for resolved observations of outflows in more galaxies.
