 Silicon mononitride ($^{28}$Si$^{14}$N, $^{29}$Si$^{14}$N, $^{30}$Si$^{14}$N,
$^{28}$Si$^{15}$N) line lists covering infrared, visible and ultraviolet
regions are presented. The \name\ line lists produced by ExoMol include
rovibronic transitions between six electronic states: \XS, \AS, \BS, \DS, \asi,
\bsi. The \ai\ potential energy and coupling curves, computed at the
multireference configuration interaction (MRCI/aug-cc-pVQZ) level of theory,
are refined for the observed states by fitting their analytical representations
to 1052 experimentally derived SiN energy levels determined from rovibronic
bands belonging to the $X$--$X$, $A$--$X$ and $B$--$X$ electronic systems
through the MARVEL procedure. The SiNful line lists are compared to previously
observed spectra, recorded and calculated lifetimes, and previously calculated
partition functions. SiNful is available via the \url{www.exomol.com} database.
