 Gamma-ray burst GRB 211211A may have been the result of a neutron star merger
at $\approx350$ Mpc. However, none of the LIGO-Virgo detectors were operating
at the time. We show that the gravitational-wave signal from a \grb-like binary
neutron star inspiral in the next LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4) would be
below the conventional detection threshold, however a coincident gamma-ray
burst observation would provide necessary information to claim a
statistically-significant multimessenger observation. We calculate that with O4
sensitivity, approximately $11\%$ of gamma-ray bursts within 600 Mpc will
produce a confident association between the gravitational-wave binary neutron
star inspiral signature and the prompt gamma-ray signature. This corresponds to
a coincident detection rate of $\unit[0.22^{+8.3}_{-0.22}]{yr^{-1}}$, where the
uncertainties are the 90\% confidence intervals arising from uncertainties in
the absolute merger rate, beaming and jet-launching fractions. These increase
to approximately $34\%$ and $\unit[0.71^{+26.8}_{-0.70}]{yr^{-1}}$ with
proposed O5 sensitivity. We show that the above numbers do not depend
significantly on the number of gravitational-wave observatories operating with
the specific sensitivity. That is, the number of confident joint gamma-ray
burst and gravitational-wave detections is only marginally improved with two or
three detectors operating compared to a single detector. It is therefore worth
considering whether one detector with sufficient sensitivity (post O4) should
remain in sky-watch mode at all times to elucidate the true nature of GRB
211211A-like events, a proposal we discuss in detail.
