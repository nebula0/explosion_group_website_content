 We present the first results from a high resolution simulation with a focus
on galactic wind driving for an isolated galaxy with a halo mass of $\sim
10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ (similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud) and a total gas
mass of $\sim 6 \times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$, resulting in $\sim 10^{8}$ gas
cells at $\sim 4$ M$_{\odot}$ mass resolution. We adopt a resolved stellar
feedback model with non-equilibrium cooling and heating, including
photoelectric heating and photo-ionizing radiation, as well as supernovae
(SNe), coupled to the second order meshless finite mass (MFM) method for
hydrodynamics. These features make this the largest resolved-ISM galaxy model
run to date. We find mean star formation rates around $0.05$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ and evaluate typical time averaged loading factors for mass
($\eta_\mathrm{M}$ $\sim$ 1.0, in good agreement with recent observations) and
energy ($\eta_\mathrm{E}$ $\sim$ 0.01). The bulk of the mass of the wind is
transported by the warm ($T < 5 \times 10^5$K) phase, while there is a similar
amount of energy transported in the warm and the hot phases ($T > 5 \times
10^5$K). We find an average opening angle of 30 degrees for the wind,
decreasing with higher altitude above the midplane. The wind mass loading is
decreasing (flat) for the warm (hot) phase as a function of the star formation
surface rate density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, while the energy loading shows
inverted trends with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, decreasing for the warm wind and
increasing for the hot wind, although with very shallow slopes. These scalings
are in good agreement with previous simulations of resolved wind driving in the
multi-phase ISM.
