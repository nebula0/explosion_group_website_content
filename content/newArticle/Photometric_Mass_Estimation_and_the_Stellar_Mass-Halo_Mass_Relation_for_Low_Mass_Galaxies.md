 We present a photometric halo mass estimation technique for local galaxies
that enables us to establish the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation down to
stellar masses of 10$^5$ M$_\odot$. We find no detectable differences among the
SMHM relations of four local galaxy clusters or between the cluster and field
relations and we find agreement with extrapolations of previous SMHM relations
derived using abundance matching approaches. We fit a power law to our
empirical SMHM relation and find that for adopted NFW dark matter profiles and
for M$_* < 10^9$ M$_\odot$, the halo mass is M$_h = 10^{10.35\pm0.02}({\rm
M}_*/10^8 {\rm M}_\odot)^{0.63\pm0.02}$. The normalisation of this relation is
susceptible to systematic modelling errors that depend on the adopted dark
matter potential and the quoted uncertainties refer to the uncertainties in the
median relation. For galaxies with M$_* < 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$ that satisfy our
selection criteria, the scatter about the fit in $M_h$, including uncertainties
arising from our methodology, is 0.3 dex. Finally, we place lower luminosity
Local Group galaxies on the SMHM relationship using the same technique,
extending it to M$_* \sim 10^3$ M$_\odot$ and suggest that some of these
galaxies show evidence for additional mass interior to the effective radius
beyond that provided by the standard dark matter profile. If this mass is in
the form of a central black hole, the black hole masses are in the range of
intermediate mass black holes, $10^{(5.7\pm0.6)}$ M$_\odot$, which corresponds
to masses of a few percent of M$_h$, well above values extrapolated from the
relationships describing more massive galaxies.
