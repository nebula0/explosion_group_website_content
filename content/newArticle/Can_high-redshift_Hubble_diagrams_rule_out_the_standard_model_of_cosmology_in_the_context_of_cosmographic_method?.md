 Using mock data for the Hubble diagrams of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and
quasars (QSOs) generated based on the standard model of cosmology, and using
the least-squares method based on the Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm, we first put constraints on the cosmographic parameters in the
context of the various model-independent cosmographic methods reconstructed
from the Taylor $4^{th}$ and $5^{th}$ order expansions and the Pade (2,2) and
(3,2) polynomials of the Hubble parameter, respectively. We then reconstruct
the distance modulus in the framework of cosmographic methods and calculate the
percentage difference between the distance modulus of the cosmographic methods
and that of the standard model. The percentage difference is minimized when the
Pade approximation is used which means that the Pade cosmographic method is
sufficiently suitable for reconstructing the distance modulus even at
high-redshifts. In the next step, using the real observational data for the
Hubble diagrams of SNIa, QSOs, gamma-ray-bursts (GRBs), and observations from
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in two sets of the low-redshift combination
(SNIa+QSOs+GRBs+BAO) embracing the redshift range of $0.01<z<2.26$ and the
high-redshift combination (SNIa+QSOs+GRBs) which covers a redshift range of
$0.01< z < 5.5$, we put observational constraints on the cosmographic
parameters of the Pade cosmography and also the standard model. Our analysis
indicates that Pade cosmographic approaches do not reveal any cosmographic
tension between the standard model and the observational data. We also confirm
this result, using the statistical AIC criteria. Finally, we put the
cosmographic method in the redshift-bin data and find a larger value of
$\Omega_{m0}$ extracted from $s_0$ parameter compared with those of the $q_0$
parameter and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM values.
