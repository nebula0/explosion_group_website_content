 We develop a novel approach to measure dust attenuation properties of
galaxies,including the dust opacity and shape of the attenuation curve in both
optical and NUV, as well as the strength of the 2175{\AA} absorption feature.
From an observed spectrum the method uses a model-independent approach to
derive a relative attenuation curve.The absolute amplitude is then calibrated
with the NIR photometry. The dust-corrected spectrum is fitted with stellar
population models to derive the dust-free model spectrum covering the whole
wavelength range from NUV to NIR and is compared with the observed SED/spectrum
to determine dust attenuation properties. We apply this method to investigate
dust attenuation on kpc scales, using a sample of 134 galaxies with the
integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA, the NIR imaging from 2MASS, and the NUV
imaging from Swift/UVOT. We find that the attenuation curves in regions of kpc
scales span a wide range of slopes in both optical and UV. The slope is
shallower at higher optical opacity, a trend that is held even when the sample
is limited to narrow ranges of specific star formation rate (sSFR),
minor-to-major axis ratio (b/a) and the location within individual galaxies.
The 2175{\AA} bump in the attenuation curve at kpc scales presents a wide range
of strength. The strength shows a strong negative correlation with the sSFR,
but the correlations with the optical opacity, $b/a$ and the location within
individual galaxies are all weak. All these trends appear to be independent of
the stellar mass of galaxies, implying that the dust attenuation is regulated
by local processes rather than by global properties of galaxies. Our results
support the scenario that the variation of the 2175{\AA} bump is driven
predominantly by processes related to star formation, such as destruction of
small dust grains by UV radiation in star-forming regions.
