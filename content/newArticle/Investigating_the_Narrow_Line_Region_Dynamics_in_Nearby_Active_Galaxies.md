 We present dynamical models of the narrow line region (NLR) outflows in the
nearby Seyfert galaxies Mrk 3, Mrk 78, NGC 1068, and NGC 4151 using
observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and Apache Point Observatory. We
employ long-slit spectroscopy to map the spatially-resolved outflow and
rotational velocities of the ionized gas. We also perform surface brightness
decompositions of host galaxy images to constrain the enclosed stellar mass
distributions as functions of distance from the supermassive black holes
(SMBHs). Assuming that the NLR gas is accelerated by AGN radiation pressure,
and subsequently decelerated by the host galaxy and SMBH gravitational
potentials, we derive outflow velocity profiles where the gas is launched in
situ at multiple distances from the SMBH. We find a strong correlation between
the turnover (from acceleration to deceleration) radii from our models, with
the turnovers seen in the observed velocities and spatially-resolved mass
outflow rates for the AGN with bolometric luminosities $>$ 10$^{44}$ erg
sec$^{-1}$. This consistency indicates that radiation pressure is the dominant
driving mechanism behind the NLR outflows in these moderate-luminosity AGN,
with a force multiplier $\sim$500 yielding the best agreement between the
modeled and observed turnover radii. However, in Meena2021 we found that this
trend may not hold at lower luminosities, where our modeled turnover distance
for NGC 4051 is much smaller than in the observed kinematics. This result may
indicate that either additional force(s) are responsible for accelerating the
NLR outflows in low-luminosity AGN, or higher spatial resolution observations
are required to quantify their turnover radii.
