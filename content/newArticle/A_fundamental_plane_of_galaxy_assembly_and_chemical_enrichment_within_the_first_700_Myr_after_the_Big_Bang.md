 Galaxies throughout the last 12 Gyr of cosmic time follow a single, universal
fundamental plane that relates their star-formation rates (SFRs), stellar
masses ($M_\star$) and chemical abundances. Deviation from these fundamental
scaling relations would imply a drastic change in the processes that regulate
galaxy evolution. Observations have hinted at the possibility that this
relation may be broken in the very early universe. However, until recently,
chemical abundances of galaxies could be only measured reliably as far back as
redshift $z = 3.3$. With JWST, we can now characterize the SFR, $M_\star$, and
gas-phase metallicity of galaxies during the first few hundred million years
after the Big Bang, at redshifts $z\approx 7-10$. Here we show that galaxies at
this epoch follow universal SFR-$M_\star$ main-sequence and mass-metallicity
scaling relations, but their chemical abundance is a factor of three lower than
expected from the fundamental plane of later galaxies. Compared to
state-of-the-art simulations, these findings suggest a more rapid onset of
galaxy assembly and star formation than previously anticipated, and further
indicate that galaxies at this time are still intimately connected with the
intergalactic medium and subject to continuous infall of pristine gas which
effectively dilutes their metal abundances.
