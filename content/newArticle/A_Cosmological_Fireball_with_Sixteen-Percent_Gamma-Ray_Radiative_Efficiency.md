 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the universe. The
standard model invokes a relativistic fireball with a bright photosphere
emission component. How efficiently the jet converts its energy to radiation is
a long-standing problem and it is poorly constrained. A definitive diagnosis of
GRB radiation components and measurement of GRB radiative efficiency requires
prompt emission and afterglow data with high-resolution and wide-band coverage
in time and energy. Here we report a comprehensive temporal and spectral
analysis of the TeV-emitting bright GRB 190114C. Its fluence is one of the
highest of all GRBs detected so far, which allows us to perform a
high-resolution study of the prompt emission spectral properties and their
temporal evolution down to a timescale of about 0.1 s. We observe that each of
the initial pulses has a thermal component contributing $\sim20\%$ of the total
energy, the corresponding temperature and the inferred Lorentz factor of the
photosphere evolve following broken power-law shapes. From the observation of
the non-thermal spectra and the light-curve, the onset of afterglow
corresponding to the deceleration of the fireball is considered at $\sim 6$~s.
By incorporating the thermal and the non-thermal observations, as well as the
photosphere and the synchrotron radiative mechanisms, we can directly derive
the fireball energy budget with little dependence on hypothetical parameters
and to measure a $\sim 16\%$ radiative efficiency for this GRB. With the
fireball energy budget derived, the afterglow microphysics parameters can also
be constrained directly from the data.
