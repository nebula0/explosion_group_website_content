 Spiral galaxies undergo strong ram-pressure effects when they fall into the
galaxy cluster potential. As a consequence, their gas is stripped to form
extended tails within which star formation can happen, giving them the typical
jellyfish appearance. The ultraviolet imaging observations of jellyfish
galaxies provide an opportunity to understand ongoing star formation in the
stripped tails. We report the ultraviolet observations of the jellyfish
galaxies JW39, JO60, JO194 and compare with observations in optical continuum
and $\mathrm{H}{\alpha}$. We detect knots of star formation in the disk and
tails of the galaxies and find that their UV and H$\alpha$ flux are well
correlated. The optical emission line ratio maps of these galaxies are used to
identify for every region the emission mechanism, due to either star formation,
LINER or a mix of the two phenomena. The star-forming regions in the emission
line maps match very well with the regions having significant UV flux. The
central regions of two galaxies (JW39, JO194) show a reduction in UV flux which
coincides with composite or LINER regions in the emission line maps. The
galaxies studied here demonstrate significant star formation in the stripped
tails, suppressed star formation in the central regions and present a possible
case of accelerated quenching happening in jellyfish galaxies.
