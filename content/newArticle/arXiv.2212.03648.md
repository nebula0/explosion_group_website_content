        Globular clusters contain multiple stellar populations, with some previous generation of stars polluting the current stars with heavier elements. Understanding the history of globular clusters is helpful in understanding how galaxies merged and evolved and therefore constraining the site or sites of this historic pollution is a priority. The acceptable temperature and density conditions of these polluting sites depend on critical <span class="search-hit mathjax">reaction</span> rates. In this paper, three experimental studies helping to constrain astrophysically important <span class="search-hit mathjax">reaction</span> rates are briefly discussed.
