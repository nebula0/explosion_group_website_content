        Stellar streams are a promising tool to study the Milky Way&#39;s dark matter subhalo population, as interactions with subhalos could produce substructure in streams. However, other possible causes for substructure first need to be well understood. Here we studied the kinematics and the unusual morphology of the stellar stream Jhelum. Using a combination of ground-based photometry and Gaia EDR3 astrometry, we characterized the morphology of Jhelum. We combined this new data with radial velocities from the literature to perform orbit integrations of the stream in static Galactic potentials. We also carried out N-body simulations in the presence of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The new data reveal a previously unreported tertiary component in the stream, as well as several gaps and a kink-like feature in its narrow component. We find that for a range of realistic Galactic potentials, no single orbit is able to reproduce Jhelum&#39;s radial velocity data entirely. A generic property of the orbital solutions is that they share a similar orbital plane to Sagittarius and this leads to repeated encounters with the stream. Using N-body simulations that include a massive Sagittarius, we explored its effect on Jhelum, and we show that these encounters can qualitatively reproduce the narrow and broad components in Jhelum, as well as create a tertiary component in some cases. We also find evidence that such encounters can result in an apparent increase in the velocity dispersion of the stream by a factor up to four due to overlapping narrow and broad components. Our findings suggest that the Jhelum stream is even more complex than once thought; however, its morphology and kinematics can tentatively be explained via the interactions with Sagittarius. In this scenario, the formation of Jhelum&#39;s narrow and broad components occurs naturally, yet some of the smaller gap-like features remain to be explained.
