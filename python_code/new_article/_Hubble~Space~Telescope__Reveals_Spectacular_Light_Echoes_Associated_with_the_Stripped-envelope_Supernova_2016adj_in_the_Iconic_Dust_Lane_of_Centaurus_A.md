 We present a multi-band sequence of $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ images
documenting the emergence and evolution of multiple light echoes (LEs) linked
to the stripped-envelope supernova (SN) 2016adj located in the central
dust-lane of Centaurus A. Following point-spread function subtraction, we
identify the earliest LE emission associated with a SN at only $+$34 days (d)
past the epoch of $B$-band maximum. Additional HST images extending through
$+$578 d cover the evolution of LE1 taking the form of a ring, while images
taken on $+$1991 d reveals not only LE1, but also segments of a new inner LE
ring (LE2) as well as two additional outer LE rings (LE3 & LE4). Adopting the
single scattering formalism, the angular radii of the LEs suggest they
originate from discrete dust sheets in the foreground of the SN. This
information, combined with measurements of color and optical depth of the
scattering surfaces, informs a scenario with multiple sheets of clumpy dust
characterized by a varying degree of holes. In this case, the larger the LE's
angular radii, the further in the foreground of the SN its dust sheet is
located. However, an exception to this is LE2, which is formed by a dust sheet
located in closer proximity to the SN than the dust sheets producing LE1, LE3,
and LE4. The delayed appearance of LE2 can be attributed to its dust sheet
having a significant hole along the line-of-sight between the SN and Earth.
