 The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a key mission in multiwavelength and
multimessenger studies, has been surveying the gamma-ray sky from its low-Earth
orbit since 2008. Its two scientific instruments, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
(GBM) and the Large Area Telescope (LAT), cover 8 orders of magnitude in photon
energy. The GBM consists of 12 Sodium Iodide detectors and 2 Bismuth Germinate
detectors, covering the 10 keV - 40 MeV energy range, arrayed on two sides of
the spacecraft so as to view the entire sky that is not occulted by the Earth.
The LAT is a pair production telescope based on silicon strip trackers, a
Cesium Iodide calorimeter, and a plastic scintillator anticoincidence system.
It covers the energy range from about 20 MeV to more than 500 GeV, with a field
of view of about 2.4 steradians. Thanks to their huge fields of view, the
instruments can observe the entire sky with a cadence of about an hour for GBM
and about three hours for LAT. All gamma-ray data from Fermi become public
immediately, enabling a broad range of multiwavelength and multimessenger
research. Over 3000 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), including GRB 170817A associated
with a neutron star merger detected in gravitational waves, and 5000
high-energy sources, including the blazar TXS 0506+056 associated with
high-energy neutrinos, have been detected by the Fermi instruments. The Fermi
Science Support Center provides a wide array of resources to enable scientific
use of the data, including background models, source catalogs, analysis
software, documentation, and a Help Desk.
