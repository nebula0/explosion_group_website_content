 We apply 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study the rotational aspect of gas
flow patterns around eccentric companions embedded in an accretion disk around
its primary host. We sample a wide range of companion mass ratio q and disk
aspect ratio h, and confirm a generic transition from prograde (steady tidal
interaction dominated) to retrograde (background Keplerian shear dominated)
circum-companion flow when orbital eccentricity exceeds a critical value et. We
find et \sim h for sub-thermal companions while et \sim (q/h)^1/3 for
super-thermal companions, and propose an empirical formula to unify the two
scenarios. Our results also suggest that et is insensitive to modest levels of
turbulence, modeled in the form of a kinematic viscosity term. In the context
of stellar-mass Black Holes (sBHs) embedded in AGN accretion disks, the
bifurcation of their circum-stellar disk (CSD) rotation suggest the formation
of a population of nearly anti-aligned sBHs, whose relevance to low spin
gravitational waves (GW) events can be probed in more details with future
population models of sBH evolution in AGN disks, making use of our quantitative
scaling for et; In the context of circum-planetary disks (CPDs), our results
suggest the possibility of forming retrograde satellites in-situ in retrograde
CPDs around eccentric planets.
