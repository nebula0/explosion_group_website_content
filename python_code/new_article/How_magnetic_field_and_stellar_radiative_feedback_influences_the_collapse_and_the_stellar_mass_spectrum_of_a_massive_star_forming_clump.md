 In spite of decades of theoretical efforts, the physical origin of the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) is still debated. We aim at understanding
the influence of various physical processes such as radiative stellar feedback,
magnetic field and non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics on the IMF. We present a
series of numerical simulations of collapsing 1000 M$_\odot$ clumps taking into
account radiative feedback and magnetic field with spatial resolution down to 1
AU. Both ideal and non-ideal MHD runs are performed and various radiative
feedback efficiencies are considered. We also develop analytical models that we
confront to the numerical results. The sum of the luminosities produced by the
stars in the calculations is computed and it compares well with the bolometric
luminosities reported in observations of massive star forming clumps. The
temperatures, velocities and densities are also found to be in good agreement
with recent observations. The stellar mass spectrum inferred for the
simulations is, generally speaking, not strictly universal and in particular
varies with magnetic intensity. It is also influenced by the choice of the
radiative feedback efficiency. In all simulations, a sharp drop in the stellar
distribution is found at about $M_{min} \simeq$ 0.1 M$_\odot$, which is likely
a consequence of the adiabatic behaviour induced by dust opacities at high
densities. As a consequence, when the combination of magnetic and thermal
support is not too large, the mass distribution presents a peak located at
0.3-0.5 M$_\odot$. When magnetic and thermal support are large, the mass
distribution is better described by a plateau, i.e. $d N / d \log M \propto
M^{-\Gamma}$, $\Gamma \simeq 0$. Abridged
