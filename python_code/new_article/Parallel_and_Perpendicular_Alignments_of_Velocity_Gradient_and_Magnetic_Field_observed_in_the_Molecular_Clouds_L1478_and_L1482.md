 Star formation is a complex process that typically occurs in dense regions of
molecular clouds mainly regulated by magnetic fields, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence, and self-gravity. However, it remains a challenging endeavor to
trace the magnetic field and determine regions of gravitational collapse where
the star is forming. Based on the anisotropic properties of MHD turbulence, a
new technique termed Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) has been proposed to
address these challenges. In this study, we apply the VGT to two regions of the
giant California Molecular Cloud (CMC), namely, L1478 and L1482, and analyze
the difference in their physical properties. We use the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO,
and C$^{18}$O emission lines observed with the Submillimeter Telescope. We
compare VGT results calculated in the resolutions of $3.3'$ and $10'$ to Planck
polarization at 353 GHz and $10'$ to determine areas of MHD turbulence
dominance and gravitational collapse dominance. We show that the resolution
difference can introduce misalignment between the two measurements. We find the
VGT-measured magnetic fields globally agree with that from Planck in L1478
suggesting self-gravity's effect is insignificant. The best agreement appears
in VGT-$^{12}$CO. As for L1482, the VGT measurements are statistically
perpendicular to the Planck polarization indicating the dominance of
self-gravity. This perpendicular alignment is more significant in VGT-$^{13}$CO
and VGT-C$^{18}$O.
