 We identify and investigate a possible correlation between the $\rm{[CII]}
158{\mu}m$ luminosity and linewidth in the $\rm{[CII]}$-detected galaxies.
Observationally, the strength of the $\rm{[CII]} 158{\mu}m$ emission line is
usually stronger than that of the CO emission line and this $\rm{[CII]}$ line
has been used as another tracer of the galactic characteristics. Moreover, many
$\rm{[CII]}$-detected galaxies are identified in $z > 4$. Motivated by previous
studies of the CO luminosity - FWHM correlation relation (LFR) and the
available new $\rm{[CII]}$ measurements, we compile samples of the
$\rm{[CII]}$-detected galaxies in the literature and perform the linear
regression analysis. The $\rm{[CII]}$ LFR is confirmed at a robust level. We
also demonstrate the possible application of the $\rm{[CII]}$ LFR by utilizing
it on the distance measurement of the high-$z$ galaxy. As a result, we extend
the cosmic spatial scale beyond the redshift $z$ of $7$. With the outcome of
the distance measurement, we constrain the cosmology parameters in the
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model, which considers the evolution of dark energy.
Consequently, the uncertainties of the $\textit{w}_{0}$ and $\textit{w}_{a}$
are reduced significantly when the measured distance data of the
$\rm{[CII]}$-detected galaxies are included in the cosmological parameter
constraint, exemplifying the potential of using the $\rm{[CII]}$-detected
galaxies as a tracer to constrain the cosmological parameters.
