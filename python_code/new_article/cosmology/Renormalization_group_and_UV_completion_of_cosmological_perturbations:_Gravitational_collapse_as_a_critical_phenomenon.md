 Cosmological perturbation theory is known to converge poorly for predicting
the spherical collapse and void evolution of collisionless matter. Using the
exact parametric solution as a testing ground, we develop two asymptotic
methods in spherical symmetry that resolve the gravitational evolution to much
higher accuracy than Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT), which is the current
gold standard in the literature. One of the methods selects a stable
fixed-point solution of the renormalization-group flow equation, thereby
predicting already at the leading order the critical exponent of the phase
transition to collapsed structures. The other method completes the truncated
LPT series far into the ultra-violet (UV) regime, by adding a non-analytic term
that captures the critical nature of the gravitational collapse. We find that
the UV method most accurately resolves the evolution of the non-linear density
as well as its one-point probability distribution function. Similarly accurate
predictions are achieved with the renormalization-group method, especially when
paired with Pad\'e approximants. Further, our results yield new, very accurate,
formulae to relate linear and non-linear density contrasts. Finally, we chart
possible ways on how to adapt our methods to the case of cosmological random
field initial conditions.
