 We present a further observational analysis of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model
proposed in Akarsu et al. [Phys. Rev. D 104, 123512 (2021)]. This model is
based on the the recent conjecture suggesting the universe has transitioned
from anti-de Sitter vacua to de Sitter vacua (viz., the cosmological constant
switches sign from negative to positive), at redshift ${z_\dagger\sim2}$,
inspired by the graduated dark energy (gDE) model proposed in Akarsu et al.
[Phys. Rev. D 101, 063528 (2020)]. $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM was previously claimed
to simultaneously relax five cosmological discrepancies, namely, the $H_0$,
$S_8$, and $M_B$ tensions along with the Ly-$\alpha$ and $\omega_{\rm b}$
anomalies, which prevail within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model as well as its
canonical/simple extensions. In the present work, we extend the previous
analysis by constraining the model using the Pantheon data (with and without
the SH0ES $M_B$ prior) and/or the completed BAO data along with the full Planck
CMB data. We find that $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM exhibits a better fit to the data
compared to $\Lambda$CDM, and relaxes the six discrepancies of $\Lambda$CDM,
namely, the $H_0$, $M_B$, $S_8$, Ly-$\alpha$, $t_0$, and $\omega_{\rm b}$
discrepancies, each one discussed in detail. When the $M_B$ prior is included
in the analyses, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM performs significantly better in relaxing
the $H_0$, $M_B$, and $S_8$ tensions with the constraint ${z_\dagger\sim1.8}$
even when the Ly-$\alpha$ data (which imposed the $z_\dagger\sim2$ constraint
in the previous studies) are excluded. In contrast, the presence of the $M_B$
prior causes only negligible improvements for $\Lambda$CDM. Thus, the
$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model provides remedy to various cosmological tensions
simultaneously, only that the galaxy BAO data hinder its success to some
extent.
