 We study the performance of three pairs of tilted $\Lambda$CDM cosmological
models, two pairs allowing for non-flat spatial hypersurfaces with CMB
temperature and polarization power spectrum data (P18) from Planck, P18 lensing
(lensing), and non-CMB data (non-CMB). For the six models, we measure
cosmological parameters and study whether or not pairs of the data sets are
mutually consistent in these models. Half of these models allow the lensing
consistency parameter $A_L$ to be an additional free parameter, while the other
three have $A_L = 1$. The tilted spatially-flat models assume the usual
primordial spatial inhomogeneity power spectrum. The tilted non-flat models
assume either the primordial power spectrum used in the Planck group analyses
[Planck $P(q)$] or a recently computed power spectrum [new $P(q)$]. In the
tilted non-flat models with $A_L=1$ we find differences between P18 data and
non-CMB data cosmological parameter constraints, which are large enough to rule
out the Planck $P(q)$ model at 3$\sigma$ but not the new $P(q)$ model. While
both P18 data and non-CMB data separately favor a closed geometry when
P18+non-CMB data are jointly analyzed the evidence in favor of non-flat
hypersurfaces subsides. Differences between P18 data and non-CMB data
cosmological constraints subside when $A_L$ is allowed to vary. From the most
restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data combination we get almost
model-independent constraints and find that the $A_L>1$ option is preferred
over the $\Omega_k<0$ one, with the $A_L$ parameter, for all models, being
larger than unity by $\sim 2.5\sigma$. According to the deviance information
criterion, in the P18+lensing+non-CMB analysis, the varying $A_L$ option is on
the verge of being strongly favored over the $A_L=1$ one, which could indicate
a problem for the standard tilted flat $\Lambda$CDM model (Abridged abstract).
