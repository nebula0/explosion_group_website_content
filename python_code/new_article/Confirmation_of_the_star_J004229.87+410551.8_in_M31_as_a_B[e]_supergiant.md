 We study the luminous blue variable candidate J004229.87+410551.8 in the
Andromeda Galaxy. Earlier, the star displayed a spectral anomaly: although a
hot emission spectrum had been detected, it had strong CaII H and K absorption
lines. Subsequently the star was assumed to be a hot hypergiant or a B[e]
supergiant. For the purpose of clear star classification, we conducted
spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the object and its surroundings with
the 6-m telescope of SAO RAS, the 3.5-m ARC telescope of the Apache Point
Observatory and the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasus Mountain Observatory of the
Sternberg Astronomical Institute. The spectrum of the star has the FeII,
[FeII], [OI], and Balmer emission lines. Its spectral energy distribution shows
an excess in the near-infrared range due to hot circumstellar dust. The
indicated features and a high estimated value of star's luminosity ($\log
(L/L_{\odot}) = 4.6\pm 0.2$) allow us to finally classify the object as a B[e]
supergiant.
