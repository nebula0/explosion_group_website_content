 Radio-detection is a mature technique that has gained large momentum over the
past decades. Its physical detection principle is mainly driven by the
electromagnetic part of the shower, and is therefore not too sensitive to
uncertainties on hadronic interactions. Furthermore its technical detection
principle allows for a 100% duty cycle, and large surface coverage thanks to
the low cost of antennas. Various detection methods of UHE particles now rely
on the radio signal as main observable. For instance, ground based experiments
such as AERA on the Pierre Auger Observatory or LOFAR detect the radio emission
from air-showers induced by high-energy particles in the atmosphere; in-ice
experiment such as ARA, IceCube, or ARIANNA benefits from a detection in denser
media which reduces the interaction lengths; finally, balloon experiments such
as ANITA allow for very sensitive UHE neutrino detection with only a few
antennas. Radio-detection is now focused on building increasingly large-scale
radio experiments to enhance the detector sensitivity and address the low
fluxes at UHE. In this proceeding we give an overview of the past, current and
future experiments for the detection of UHE cosmic particles using the radio
technique in air (AERA, Auger-Prime, GRAND), in balloon (ANITA, PUEO) or in
other media (IceCube-Gen2, BEACON, RNO-G).
