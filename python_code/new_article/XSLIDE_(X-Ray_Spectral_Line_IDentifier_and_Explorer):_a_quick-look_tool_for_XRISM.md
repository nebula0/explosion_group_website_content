 We present XSLIDE (X-Ray Spectral Line IDentifier and Explorer), a graphical
user interface that has been designed as a quick-look tool for the upcoming
X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). XSLIDE is a simple and
user-friendly application that allows for the interactive plotting of spectra
from XRISM's Resolve instrument without requiring the selection of models for
forward-fitting. XSLIDE performs common tasks such as rebinning, continuum
fitting, automatically detecting lines, assigning detected lines to known
atomic transitions, spectral diagnostics, and more. It is expected that XSLIDE
will allow XRISM's scientific investigators to rapidly examine many spectra to
find those which contain spectral lines of particular interest, and it will
also allow astronomers from outside the field of high-resolution X-ray
spectroscopy to easily interact with XRISM data.
