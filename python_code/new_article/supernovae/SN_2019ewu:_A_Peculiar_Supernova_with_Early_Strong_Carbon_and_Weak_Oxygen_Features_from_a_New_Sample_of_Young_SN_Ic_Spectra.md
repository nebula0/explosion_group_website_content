 With the advent of high cadence, all-sky automated surveys, supernovae (SNe)
are now discovered closer than ever to their dates of explosion. However, young
pre-maximum light follow-up spectra of Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), probably
arising from the most stripped massive stars, remain rare despite their
importance. In this paper we present a set of 49 optical spectra observed with
the Las Cumbres Observatory through the Global Supernova Project for 6 SNe Ic,
including a total of 17 pre-maximum spectra, of which 8 are observed more than
a week before V-band maximum light. This dataset increases the total number of
publicly available pre-maximum light SN Ic spectra by 25% and we provide
publicly available SNID templates that will significantly aid in the fast
identification of young SNe Ic in the future. We present detailed analysis of
these spectra, including Fe II 5169 velocity measurements, O I 7774 line
strengths, and continuum shapes. We compare our results to published samples of
stripped supernovae in the literature and find one SN in our sample that stands
out. SN 2019ewu has a unique combination of features for a SN Ic: an extremely
blue continuum, high absorption velocities, a P-cygni shaped feature almost 2
weeks before maximum light that TARDIS radiative transfer modeling attributes
to C II rather than H$\alpha$, and weak or non-existent O I 7774 absorption
feature until maximum light.
