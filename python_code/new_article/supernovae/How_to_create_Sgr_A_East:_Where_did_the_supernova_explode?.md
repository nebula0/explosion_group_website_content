 Sgr A East is the supernova remnant closest to the centre of the Milky Way.
Its age has been estimated to be either very young, around 1-2 kyr, or about 10
kyr, and its exact origin remains unclear. We aspire to create a simple model
of a supernova explosion that reproduces the shape, size, and location of Sgr A
East. Using a simplified hydrodynamical code, we simulated the evolution of a
supernova remnant in the medium around the Galactic centre. The latter consists
of a nearby massive molecular cloud with which Sgr A East is known to be
interacting and a wind from the nuclear star cluster. Our preferred models of
the Sgr A East remnant are compatible with an age of around 10 kyr. We also
find suitable solutions for older ages, but not for ages younger than 5 kyr.
Our simulations predict that the supernova exploded at a distance of about 3.5
pc from the Galactic centre, below the Galactic plane, slightly eastwards from
the centre and 3 pc behind it.
