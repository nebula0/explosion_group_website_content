 Although only a small fraction of stars end their lives as supernovae, all
supernovae leave behind a supernova remnant (SNR), an expanding shock wave that
interacts with the surrounding medium, heating the gas and seeding the cosmos
with elements forged in the progenitor In this chapter, we introduce the basic
properties of galactic and extragalactic SNRs (Section 2). We summarize how
SNRs evolve throughout their life cycles over the course of ~10^6 yrs (Section
3). We discuss the various morphological types of SNRs and discuss the emission
processes at various wavelengths.(Section 4).
