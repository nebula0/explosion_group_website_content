 We measure the molecular gas environment near recent ($< 100$ yr old)
supernovae (SNe) using $\sim1''$ or $\leq 150$pc resolution CO (2-1) maps from
the PHANGS-ALMA survey of nearby star-forming galaxies. This is arguably the
first such study to approach the scales of individual massive molecular clouds
($M_{\rm mol} \gtrsim 10^{5.3}$ M$_{\odot}$). Using the Open Supernova Catalog
(OSC), we identify 63 SNe within the PHANGS-ALMA footprint. We detect CO (2-1)
emission near $\sim60\%$ of the sample at 150pc resolution, compared to
$\sim35\%$ of map pixels with CO (2-1) emission, and up to $\sim95\%$ of the
SNe at 1kpc resolution compared to $\sim80\%$ of map pixels with CO (2-1)
emission. We expect the $\sim60\%$ of SNe within the same 150pc beam as a GMC
will likely interact with these clouds in the future, consistent with the
observation of widespread SN-molecular gas interaction in the Milky Way, while
the other $\sim40\%$ of SNe without strong CO (2-1) detections will deposit
their energy in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), perhaps helping drive
large-scale turbulence or galactic outflows. Broken down by type, we detect CO
(2-1) emission at the sites of $\sim85\%$ of our 9 stripped-envelope SNe
(SESNe), $\sim40\%$ of our 34 Type II SNe, and $\sim35\%$ of our 13 Type Ia
SNe, indicating that SESNe are most closely associated with the brightest CO
(2-1) emitting regions in our sample. Our results confirm that SN explosions
are not restricted to only the densest gas, and instead exert feedback across a
wide range of molecular gas densities.
