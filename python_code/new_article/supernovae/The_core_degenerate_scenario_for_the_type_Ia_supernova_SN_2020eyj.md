 We argue that the core degenerate (CD) scenario of type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia) can explain the compact helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM) of SN
2020eyj. In the new channel of the CD scenario that we propose there are two
major common envelope evolution (CEE) phases. After the white dwarf (WD)
companion removes the hydrogen-rich envelope of the asymptotic giant branch
star its spiralling-in halts at few solar radii from the core, rather than
continuing to the carbon-oxygen (CO) core as in the hydrogen-rich SNe Ia-CSM CD
scenario. Only hundreds to tens of thousands of years later, after the
helium-rich core expands, does the WD enters a CEE with the helium-rich layer.
By that time the hydrogen-rich envelope is at a large distance from the center.
The WD merges with the CO core during the second CEE phase, and only after a
merger to explosion delay (MED) time of weeks to tens of years the merger
remnant explodes. The SN Ia ejecta collides with a helium-rich CSM at tens to
hundreds of AU. We follow the evolution of two stellar models with initial
masses of 5Mo and 7Mo to their asymptotic giant branch phase when they are
supposed to engulf the WD companion. We find that there is a sufficiently
massive CO core to merge with the WD in the frame of the CD scenario as well as
a massive helium-rich layer, 0.3-1Mo, to account for the helium-rich CSM of SN
2020eyj.
