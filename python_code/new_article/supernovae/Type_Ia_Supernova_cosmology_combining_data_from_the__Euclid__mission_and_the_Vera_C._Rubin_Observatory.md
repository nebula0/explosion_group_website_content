 The $Euclid$ mission will provide first-of-its-kind coverage in the
near-infrared over deep (three fields, $\sim$10-20 square degrees each) and
wide ($\sim$10000 square degrees) fields. While the survey is not designed to
discover transients, the deep fields will have repeated observations over a
two-week span, followed by a gap of roughly six months. In this analysis, we
explore how useful the deep field observations will be for measuring properties
of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using simulations that include $Euclid$'s
planned depth, area and cadence in the deep fields, we calculate that more than
3700 SNe between $0.0<z<1.5$ will have at least five $Euclid$ detections around
peak with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 3. While on their own, $Euclid$
light curves are not good enough to directly constrain distances, when combined
with LSST deep field observations, we find that uncertainties on SN distances
are reduced by 20-30% for $z<0.8$ and by 40-50% for $z>0.8$. Furthermore, we
predict how well additional $Euclid$ mock data can be used to constrain a key
systematic in SN Ia studies - the size of the luminosity 'step' found between
SNe hosted in high mass ($>10^{10} M_{\odot}$) and low mass ($>10^{10}
M_{\odot}$) galaxies. This measurement has unique information in the rest-frame
NIR. We predict that if the step is caused by dust, we will be able to measure
its reduction in the NIR compared to optical at the 4$\sigma$ level. We
highlight that the LSST and $Euclid$ observing strategies used in this work are
still provisional and some level of joint processing is required. Still, these
first results are promising, and assuming $Euclid$ begins observations well
before the Nancy Roman Space Telescope (Roman), we expect this dataset to be
extremely helpful for preparation for Roman itself.
