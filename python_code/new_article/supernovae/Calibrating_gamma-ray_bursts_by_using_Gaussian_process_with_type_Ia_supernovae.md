 In this paper, we calibrate the Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\rm iso}$
correlation) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in a cosmology-independent way. By
using Gaussian process to reconstruct the smoothed luminosity distance from the
Pantheon type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) sample, we utilize the reconstructed
results to calibrate the $E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation with the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method and construct a Hubble diagram with the A220 GRB data,
in which A118 GRB data with the higher qualities appropriate for cosmological
purposes. With 98 GRBs at $1.4<z\leq8.2$ in A118 sample and the observed Hubble
data, we obtain $\Omega_m$ = $0.346^{+0.048}_{-0.069}$, $h$ =
$0.677^{+0.029}_{-0.029}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega_m$ =
$0.314^{+0.072}_{-0.055}$, $h$ = $0.705^{+0.055}_{-0.069}$, $w$ =
$-1.23^{+0.33}_{-0.64}$ for the flat $w$CDM model, which are consistent with
those from fitting the coefficients of the Amati relation and the cosmological
parameters simultaneously.
