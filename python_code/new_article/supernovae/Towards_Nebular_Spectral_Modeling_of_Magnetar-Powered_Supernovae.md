 Many energetic supernovae are thought to be powered by the rotational-energy
of a highly-magnetized, rapidly-rotating neutron star. The emission from the
associated luminous pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can photoionize the supernova
ejecta, leading to a nebular spectrum of the ejecta with signatures possibly
revealing the PWN. SN 2012au is hypothesized to be one such supernova. We
investigate the impact of different ejecta and PWN parameters on the supernova
nebular spectrum, and test if any photoionization models are consistent with SN
2012au. We study how constraints from the nebular phase can be linked into
modelling of the diffusion phase and the radio emission of the magnetar. We
present a suite of late-time (1-6y) spectral simulations of SN ejecta powered
by an inner PWN. Over a large grid of 1-zone models, we study the behaviour of
the SN physical state and line emission as PWN luminosity ($L_{\rm PWN}$),
injection SED temperature ($T_{\rm PWN}$), ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$), and
composition (pure O or realistic) vary. We discuss the resulting emission in
the context of the observed behaviour of SN 2012au, a strong candidate for a
PWN-powered SN. The supernova nebular spectrum varies as $T_{\rm PWN}$ varies,
as the ejecta become less ionized as $T_{\rm PWN}$ increases. Low ejecta mass
models at high PWN power obtain runaway ionization for O I and, in extreme
cases, also O II, causing a sharp decrease in their ion fraction over a small
change in the parameter space. Certain models can reproduce the oxygen lines
luminosities of SN 2012au reasonably well at individual epochs, but we find no
model that fits over the whole time evolution; this is likely due to the simple
model setup. Using our derived constraints from the nebular phase, we predict
that the magnetar powering SN 2012au had an initial rotation period $\sim$ 15
ms, and should be a strong radio source (F > 100 mJy) for decades.
