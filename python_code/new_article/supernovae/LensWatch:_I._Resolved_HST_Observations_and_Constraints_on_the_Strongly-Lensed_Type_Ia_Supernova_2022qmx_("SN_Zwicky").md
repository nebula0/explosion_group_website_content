 Supernovae (SNe) that have been multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing are
rare and powerful probes for cosmology. Each detection is an opportunity to
develop the critical tools and methodologies needed as the sample of lensed SNe
increases by orders of magnitude with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory
and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The latest such discovery is of the
quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, "SN Zwicky"; Goobar et al. 2022) at z
= 0.3544. SN Zwicky was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in
spatially unresolved data. Here we present follow-up Hubble Space Telescope
observations of SN Zwicky, the first from the multi-cycle "LensWatch" program
(www.lenswatch.org). We measure photometry for each of the four images of SN
Zwicky, which are resolved in three WFC3/UVIS filters (F475W, F625W, F814W) but
unresolved with WFC3/IR F160W, and produce an analysis of the lensing system
using a variety of independent lens modeling methods. We find consistency
between time delays estimated with the single epoch of HST photometry and the
lens model predictions constrained through the multiple image positions, with
both inferring time delays of <1 day. Our lens models converge to an Einstein
radius of (0.168+0.009-0.005)", the smallest yet seen in a lensed SN. The
"standard candle" nature of SN Zwicky provides magnification estimates
independent of the lens modeling that are brighter by ~1.5 mag and ~0.8 mag for
two of the four images, suggesting significant microlensing and/or additional
substructure beyond the flexibility of our image-position mass models.
