 Fluorine has many different potential sites and channels of production,
making narrowing down a dominant site of fluorine production particularly
challenging. In this work, we investigate which sources are the dominant
contributors to the galactic fluorine by comparing chemical evolution models to
observations of fluorine abundances in Milky Way stars covering a metallicity
range -2$<$[Fe/H]$<$0.4 and upper limits in the range -3.4$<$[Fe/H]$<$-2.3. In
our models, we use a variety of stellar yield sets in order to explore the
impact of varying both AGB and massive star yields on the chemical evolution of
fluorine. In particular, we investigate different prescriptions for initial
rotational velocity in massive stars as well as a metallicity dependent mix of
rotational velocities. We find that the observed [F/O] and [F/Fe] abundance
ratios at low metallicity and the increasing trend of [F/Ba] at
[Fe/H]$\gtrsim$-1 can only be reproduced by chemical evolution models assuming,
at all metallicities, a contribution from rapidly rotating massive stars with
initial rotational velocities as high as 300km s$^{-1}$. A mix of rotational
velocities may provide a more physical solution than the sole use of massive
stars with $v_{\text{rot}}$=300$\text{km s}^{-1}$, which are predicted to
overestimate the fluorine and average s-process elemental abundances at
[Fe/H]$\gtrsim$-1. The contribution from AGB stars is predicted to start at
[Fe/H]$\approx$-1 and becomes increasingly important at high metallicity, being
strictly coupled to the evolution of the nitrogen abundance. Finally, by using
modern yield sets, we investigate the fluorine abundances of Wolf-Rayet winds,
ruling them out as dominant contributors to the galactic fluorine.
