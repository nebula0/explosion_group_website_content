 Integrated-light models that incorporate common types of chemically peculiar
(CP) stars are assembled using synthetic spectra. Selected spectral features
encode significant age information for populations with ages $\sim$50 Myr $<$
age $< \sim$2 Gyr. Due to the alleviation of template mismatch, the inclusion
of CP star features in model spectra improves the accuracy of recovered stellar
population parameters, but we are not able to show that new or unique age
information can be extracted from the weak CP features compared to continuum
fitting and strong-feature strengths, at least at the present state of the art.
An age-extraction routine that recovers 2- and 3-burst age structures is
employed to analyze the spectra of local group galaxies. NGC 224 (M31) has a
stellar population too old for the types of CP stars we examine. NGC 221 (M32)
also shows no CP spectral features. It appears to contain a component at age
$\sim$1 Gyr at 1% by mass in addition to its dominant 4.7 Gyr population.
Unlike SDSS galaxy spectrum averages, NGC 205 (M110) contains no features due
to HgMn stars. This excludes the age range associated with HgMn production, and
its near-nuclear spectrum is best fit by a 68$\pm$2 Myr population superimposed
on an older population with a 1.85$\pm$0.1 Gyr component. Both NGC 205 and NGC
221 have an ancient component whose mass is not easy to constrain given the
overwhelming light-dominance of the younger populations.
