 HERMES Pathfinder (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites
Pathfinder) is a space mission based on a constellation of nano-satellites in a
low Earth Orbit, hosting new miniaturized detectors to probe the X-ray temporal
emission of bright high-energy transients such as Gamma-Ray Bursts and the
electromagnetic counterparts of Gravitational Waves. This ambitious goal will
be achieved exploiting at most Commercial offthe-shelf components. For
HERMES-SP, a custom Power Supply Unit board has been designed to supply the
needed voltages to the payload and, at the same time, protecting it from
Latch-Up events.
