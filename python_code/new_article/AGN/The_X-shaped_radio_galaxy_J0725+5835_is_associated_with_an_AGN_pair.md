 X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) are those that exhibit two pairs of unaligned
radio lobes (main radio lobes and "wings"), one of the promising models for the
peculiar morphology is jet re-orientation. To clarify it, we conducted the
European VLBI Network (EVN) 5 GHz observation of an XRG J0725+5835, which
resembles the archetypal binary AGNs 0402+379 in radio morphology but it is
larger in angular size. In our observation, two milliarcsec (mas) scale radio
components with non-thermal radio emission are detected, each of them coincides
with an optical counterpart with similar photometric redshift and (optical and
infrared) magnitude, corresponding to dual active nuclei. Furthermore, with the
improved VLA images, we find a bridge between the two radio cores and a jet
bending in the region surrounding the companion galaxy, which further supports
the interplay between the main and companion galaxies. In addition, we also
report the discovery of an arcsec-scale jet in the companion. Given the
projected separation of $\sim100$ kpc between the main and companion galaxies,
XRG J0725+5835 is likely associated with a dual jetted-AGN system. In both EVN
and VLA observations, we find signatures that the jet is changing its
direction, which is likely responsible for the X-shaped morphology. On the
origin of jet re-orientation, several scenarios are discussed.
