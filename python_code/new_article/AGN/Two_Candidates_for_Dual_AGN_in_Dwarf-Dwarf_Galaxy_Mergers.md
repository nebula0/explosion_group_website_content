 Dual AGN are important for understanding galaxy-merger-triggered fueling of
black holes and hierarchical growth of structures. The least explored type of
dual AGN are those associated with mergers of two dwarf galaxies. According to
observations and cosmological simulations, dwarf galaxies are the most abundant
type of galaxies in the early Universe and the galaxy merger rate is dominated
by dwarfs. However, these mergers are generally too distant to be directly
observed, and low-redshift dwarf-dwarf merger-related dual AGN are notoriously
hard to find. In this paper, we present the first results of our large-scale
search for this elusive type of object and the first two candidates for dual
AGN in dwarf-dwarf mergers. Both objects exhibit tidal features (tails and
bridges) characteristic of galaxy mergers/interactions. One object is
apparently in a late-stage merger with an AGN separation of < 5kpc, while the
second is in an early-stage merger with interacting galaxies having established
a tidal bridge. Both objects have dual, luminous X-ray sources that are most
likely due to actively accreting massive black holes. Also, both objects have
infrared counterparts, with colors consistent with being AGN. Follow-up
observations will provide us a glimpse into key processes that govern the
earliest phases of growth of galaxies, their central black holes, and
merger-induced star formation.
