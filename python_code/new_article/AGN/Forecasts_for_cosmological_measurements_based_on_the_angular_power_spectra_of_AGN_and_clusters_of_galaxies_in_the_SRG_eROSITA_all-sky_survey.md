 Abstract abridged. The eROSITA X-ray telescope aboard the SRG orbital
observatory, in the course of its all-sky survey, is expected to detect about
three million active galactic nuclei (AGN) and hundred thousand clusters and
groups of galaxies. Such a sample complemented with redshift information, will
open a new window into the studies of the Large-Scale structure (LSS) of the
Universe and the determination of its cosmological parameters. The purpose of
this work is to assess the prospects of cosmological measurements with the
eROSITA sample of AGN and clusters of galaxies. We assume the availability of
photometric redshift measurements for eROSITA sources and explore the impact of
their quality on our forecasts. We use the redshift-resolved angular power
spectrum of objects. We use a Fisher-matrix formalism and assume flat LambdaCDM
cosmology to forecast the constraining power. We compute the LSS-relevant
characteristics of AGN and clusters in the framework of the halo model and
their X-ray luminosity functions. We find that the accuracy of photometric
redshift estimates has a more profound effect on cosmological measurements than
the fraction of catastrophic errors. Under realistic assumptions about the
photometric redshift quality, the marginalized errors on the cosmological
parameters achieve 1 - 10% accuracy depending on the cosmological priors used
from other experiments. The statistical significance of BAO detection in
angular power spectra of AGN and clusters of galaxies considered individually
achieves 5 - 6 sigma. Our results demonstrate that the eROSITA sample of AGN
and clusters of galaxies used in combination with currently available
photometric redshift estimates will provide cosmological constraints on a par
with dedicated optical LSS surveys.
