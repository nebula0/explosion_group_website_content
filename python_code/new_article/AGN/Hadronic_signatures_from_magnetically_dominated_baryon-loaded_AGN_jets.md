 Blazars are a rare class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic
jets pointing towards the observer. Jets are thought to be launched as
Poynting-flux dominated outflows that accelerate to relativistic speeds at the
expense of the available magnetic energy. In this work, we consider
electron-proton jets and assume that particles are energized via magnetic
reconnection in parts of the jet where the magnetization is still high ($\sigma
\ge 1$). The magnetization and bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ are related to the
available jet energy per baryon as $\mu =\Gamma(1+\sigma)$. We adopt an
observationally motivated relation between $\Gamma$ and the mass accretion rate
into the black hole $\dot{m}$, which also controls the luminosity of external
radiation fields. We numerically compute the photon and neutrino jet emission
as a function of $\mu$ and $\sigma$. We find that the blazar SED is produced by
synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation of accelerated electrons, while the
emission of hadronic-related processes is subdominant except for the highest
magnetization considered. We show that low-luminosity blazars ($L_{\gamma}
\lesssim 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) are associated with less powerful, slower jets
with higher magnetizations in the jet dissipation region. Their broadband
photon spectra resemble those of BL Lac objects, and the expected neutrino
luminosity is $L_{\nu+\bar{\nu}}\sim (0.3-1)\, L_{\gamma}$. High-luminosity
blazars ($L_{\gamma} \gg 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) are associated with more
powerful, faster jets with lower magnetizations. Their broadband photon spectra
resemble those of flat spectrum radio quasars, and they are expected to be dim
neutrino sources with $L_{\nu+\bar{\nu}}\ll L_{\gamma}$.
