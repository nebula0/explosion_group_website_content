 We analyze two distinct samples of GRBs, with and without radio afterglow
emission. We use a sample of 211 GRBs which is an update of the previous sample
from arXiv:1902.01974, and find, in agreement with previous results (although
with a sample that is almost twice as large) as the intrinsic gamma-ray
duration (Tint) and isotropic equivalent energy (Eiso) distributions between
these two populations appear to differ significantly. The redshift (z)
distributions of the two samples are not statistically different. We analyze
several correlations between variables (Eiso, Tint, jet opening angle, and z),
accounting for selection effects and redshift evolution using the
Efron-Petrosian method. We find a statistically significant anti-correlation
between the jet opening angle and redshift, as well as between Tint and
redshift, for both radio-bright and radio-dark GRBs. Finally, in agreement with
previous work, we find that very high energy (0.1 - 100 GeV) extended emission
is present in the radio-bright GRB sample only. Our work supports the
possibility that the radio-bright and the radio-dark GRBs originate from
different progenitors.
