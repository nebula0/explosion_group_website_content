 The missing baryon problem is one of the major unsolved problems in
astronomy. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond pulses with unknown
origins. The dispersion measure of FRBs is defined as the electron column
density along the line of sight, and accounts for every ionized baryon. Here we
measure the baryon content of the Universe using 22 localized FRBs. Unlike
previous works that fixed the value of dispersion measure of FRB host galaxies
and ignored the inhomogeneities of the intergalactic medium (IGM), we use the
probability distributions of dispersion measures contributed by host galaxies
and IGM from the state-of-the-art IllustrisTNG simulations. We derive the
cosmic baryon density of $\Omega_b=0.0490^{+0.0036}_{-0.0033}$ (1$\sigma$),
with a precision of 7.0%. This value is dramatically consistent with other
measurements, such as the cosmic microwave background and Big Bang
nucleosynthesis. Our work supports that the baryons are not missing, but
residing in the IGM.
