 Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) acceleration and injection into interplanetary
space during gradual SEP events is thought to take place at Coronal Mass
Ejection (CME)-driven shocks. Features of measured intensity profiles at 1 au
have been attributed to properties of the radial and longitudinal/latitudinal
injections at the shock. Focussed transport models are typically used to model
acceleration at a CME-shock and subsequent propagation. Test particle
simulations are an alternative approach but so far they have been carried out
only with instantaneous injection near the Sun. We develop the first temporally
extended shock-like injection for our 3D test particle code and investigate how
the spatial features of injection affect SEP intensity and anisotropy profiles
for observers at 0.3 and 1.0 au. We conduct simulations of a monoenergetic
population of 5 MeV protons considering three different radial injection
functions and two longitudinal/latitudinal injection functions. We consider a
range of scattering conditions with scattering mean free path values ranging
from 0.1-1.0 au, and determine intensity and anisotropy profiles at six
observers at different longitudinal locations. We find that the radial,
longitudinal and latitudinal injection functions play a relatively minor role
in shaping the SEP intensity profiles. The dependence of profiles on the value
of the scattering mean free path is also weak, unlike what is found from 1D
focussed transport models. Spatial factors, such as the time of
observer-shock-connection/disconnection and time of shock passage have a much
stronger influence on SEP intensities and anisotropies. Persistent anisotropies
until shock passage are seen in our simulations. Comparing instantaneous and
shock-like injections, we find that the link between duration of injection and
of the SEP event is very weak, unlike what is commonly assumed.
