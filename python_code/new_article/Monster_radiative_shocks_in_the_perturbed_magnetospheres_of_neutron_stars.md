 Magnetospheres of neutron stars can be perturbed by star quakes or
interaction in a binary system. The perturbations are typically in the kHz band
and excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. We show that compressive
magnetospheric waves steepen into monster shocks mediated by radiation
reaction, different from normal collisionless shocks. The shocks admit a simple
analytical description. They expand through the magnetosphere with radiative
losses, and then a blast wave is launched into the neutron-star wind. The
monster shocks offer a new possible mechanism for X-ray bursts from magnetars
and support the connection of magnetar X-ray activity with fast radio bursts.
Similar shocks should occur in magnetized neutron-star binaries in every
orbital period, generating an X-ray precursor of the binary merger. The
presented method for calculating wave propagation and shock formation may have
broader applications in relativistic MHD.
