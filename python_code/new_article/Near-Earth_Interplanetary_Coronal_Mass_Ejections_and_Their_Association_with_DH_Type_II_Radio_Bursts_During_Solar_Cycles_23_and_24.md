 We analyse the characteristics of interplanetary coronal mass ejections
(ICMEs) during Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The present analysis is primarily based
on the near-Earth ICME catalogue (Richardson and Cane, 2010). An important
aspect of this study is to understand the near-Earth and geoeffective aspects
of ICMEs in terms of their association (type II ICMEs) versus absence (non-type
II ICMEs) of decameter-hectometer (DH) type II radio bursts, detected by
Wind/WAVES and STEREOS/WAVES. Notably, DH type II radio bursts driven by a CME
indicate powerful MHD shocks leaving the inner corona and entering the
interplanetary medium. We find a drastic reduction in the occurrence of ICMEs
by 56% in Solar Cycle 24 compared to the previous cycle (64 versus 147 events).
Interestingly, despite a significant decrease in ICME/CME counts, both cycles
contain almost the same fraction of type II ICMEs (~47%). Our analysis reveals
that, even at a large distance of 1 AU, type II CMEs maintain significantly
higher speeds compared to non-type II events (523 km/s versus 440 km/s). While
there is an obvious trend of decrease in ICME transit times with increase in
the CME initial speed, there also exists a noticeable wide range of transit
times for a given CME speed. Contextually, Cycle 23 exhibits 10 events with
shorter transit times ranging between 20-40 hours of predominantly type II
categories while, interestingly, Cycle 24 almost completely lacks such "fast"
events. We find a significant reduction in the parameter $V_{ICME} \times
B_{z}$, the dawn to dusk electric field, by 39% during Solar Cycle 24 in
comparison with the previous cycle. Further, $V_{ICME} \times B_{z}$ shows a
strong correlation with Dst index, which even surpasses the consideration of
$B_{z}$ and $V_{ICME}$ alone. The above results imply the crucial role of
$V_{ICME} \times B_{z}$ toward effectively modulating the geoeffectiveness of
ICMEs.
