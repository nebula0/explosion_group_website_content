 We report an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with extremely high equivalent
width (EW), EW(LyA+NV,rest)>921 AA in the rest-frame, at z~2.24 in the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment Survey (HETDEX) as a
representative case of the high EW AGN population. The continuum level is a
non-detection in the HETDEX spectrum, thus the measured EW is a lower limit.
The source is detected with significant emission lines (>7sigma) at LyA+NV,
CIV, and moderate emission line (~4sigma) at HeII within the wavelength
coverage of HETDEX (3500 AA - 5500 AA). The r-band magnitude is 24.57 from the
Hyper Suprime-Cam-HETDEX joint survey with a detection limit of r=25.12 at
5sigma. The LyA emission line spans a clearly resolved region of ~10 arcsec (85
kpc) in diameter. The LyA line profile is strongly double peaked. The spectral
decomposed blue gas and red gas Ly$\alpha$ emission are separated by ~1.2
arcsec (10.1 kpc) with a line-of-sight velocity offset of ~1100 km/s. This
source is probably an obscured AGN with powerful winds.
