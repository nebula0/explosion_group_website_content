 High-dimensional data sets are expected from the next generation of
large-scale surveys. These data sets will carry a wealth of information about
the early stages of galaxy formation and cosmic reionization. Extracting the
maximum amount of information from the these data sets remains a key challenge.
Current simulations of cosmic reionization are computationally too expensive to
provide enough realizations to enable testing different statistical methods,
such as parameter inference. We present a non-Gaussian generative model of
reionization maps that is based solely on their summary statistics. We
reconstruct large-scale ionization fields (bubble spatial distributions)
directly from their power spectra (PS) and Wavelet Phase Harmonics (WPH)
coefficients. Using WPH, we show that our model is efficient in generating
diverse new examples of large-scale ionization maps from a single realization
of a summary statistic. We compare our model with the target ionization maps
using the bubble size statistics, and largely find a good agreement. As
compared to PS, our results show that WPH provide optimal summary statistics
that capture most of information out of a highly non-linear ionization fields.
