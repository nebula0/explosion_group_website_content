 Isolated dwarf galaxies nearly always exhibit robust star formation but
satellite dwarf galaxies are often devoid of young stars, even in Milky
Way-mass groups. Dwarf galaxies thus offer an important laboratory into the
environmental processes that cease star formation. We explore the balance of
quiescent and star-forming galaxies (quenched fractions) for a sample of ~400
satellite galaxies around 30 Local Volume hosts from the Exploration of Local
VolumE Satellites (ELVES) Survey. We present quenched fractions as a function
of satellite stellar mass, projected radius, and host halo mass, to conclude
that overall, the quenched fractions are similar to the Milky Way, dropping
below 50\% at satellite M*~10^8 Msun. There is a ~10% difference in quenched
fraction for satellites within and outside of ~R_vir/2 at fixed satellite mass.
Finally, the satellite mass at which quenching grows inefficient grows steadily
with host halo mass. Through comparison with the semi-analytic modeling code
SatGen, we are also able to infer average quenching times as a function of
satellite mass in host halo-mass bins. There is a gradual increase in quenching
time with satellite stellar mass rather than the abrupt change from rapid to
slow quenching that has been inferred for the Milky Way. We also generally
infer longer average quenching times than recent hydrodynamical simulations.
Our results vindicate models that suggest a wide range of quenching times are
possible via ram pressure stripping, depending on the clumpiness of the
circumgalactic medium, the orbits of the satellites, and the degree of earlier
preprocessing.
