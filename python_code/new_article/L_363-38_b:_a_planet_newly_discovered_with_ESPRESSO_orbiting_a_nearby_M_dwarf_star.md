 Context. Planets around stars in the solar neighbourhood will be prime
targets for characterisation with upcoming large space- and ground-based
facilities. Since large-scale exoplanet searches will not be feasible with such
telescopes, it is crucial to use currently available data and instruments to
find possible target planets before next generation facilities come online.
  Aims. We aim at detecting new extrasolar planets around stars in the solar
neighbourhood by blind radial velocity (RV) search with ESPRESSO. Our target
sample consist of nearby stars (d < 11 pc) with little (< 10) or no previous RV
measurements.
  Methods. We use 31 radial velocity measurements obtained with ESPRESSO at the
VLT between December 2020 and February 2022 of the nearby M dwarf star (M_star
= 0.21 M_sun, d = 10.23 pc) L 363-38 to derive the orbital parameters of the
newly discovered planet. In addition, we use TESS photometry and archival
VLT/NaCo high contrast imaging data to put further constraints on the orbit
inclination and the possible planetary system architecture around L 363-38.
  Results. We present the detection of a new extrasolar planet orbiting the
nearby M dwarf star L 363-38. L 363-38 b is a planet with minimum mass mp
sin(i) = 4.67+/-0.43 M_Earth orbiting its star with a period P = 8.781+/-0.007
d, corresponding to a semi-major axis a = 0.048+/-0.006 AU, which is well
inside the inner edge of the habitable zone. We further estimate a minimum
radius rp sin(i) = 1.55 - 2.75 R_Earth and an equilibrium temperature Teq =
330K.
