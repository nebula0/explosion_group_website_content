 We present the deconvolved distribution estimator (DDE), an extension of the
voxel intensity distribution (VID), in the context of future observations
proposed as part of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP). The DDE exploits the
fact that the observed VID is a convolution of correlated signal intensity
distributions and uncorrelated noise or interloper intensity distributions. By
deconvolving the individual VID of two observables away from their joint VID in
a Fourier-space operation, the DDE suppresses sensitivity to interloper
emission while maintaining sensitivity to correlated components. The DDE thus
improves upon the VID by rejecting uncorrelated noise and interloper biases,
which is useful in the context of COMAP observations that observe different
rotational transitions of CO from the same comoving volume in different
observing frequency bands. Fisher forecasts suggest that the theoretical
sensitivity in the DDE allows significant improvements in constraining power
compared to either the cross power spectrum or the individual VID data, and
matches the constraining power of the combination of all other one- and
two-point summary statistics. Future work should further investigate the
covariance and model-dependent behaviour of this novel one-point
cross-correlation statistic.
