 Circumstellar discs around Be stars are formed by the material ejected by the
central star. This process removes excess angular momentum from the star as
viscosity facilitates the mass and angular momentum transfer within the disc
and its growth. The angular momentum loss rates (AMLR) of Be stars is a subject
of debate in the literature. Through the modelling of the disc formation and
dissipation phases observed from Be stars, their average AMLR can be determined
and this is the goal of this work. We use the viscous decretion disc (VDD)
model to provide a range of the average AMLR for Be stars and compare these
rates with predicted values from the literature. We explore the reasons for
discrepancies between the predicted values of average AMLR using the VDD and
Geneva stellar evolution (GSE) models that were previously reported in
literature and find that the largest differences occur when Be stars are
rotating below their critical speeds. We show that the time over which the mass
reservoir builds up is inversely proportional to the average AMLR. Also, we
determine a revised value of the average AMLR for the Galactic Be star omega
CMa of 4.7x10^36 g cm^2/s^2, which is in better agreement with the values
expected for a typical B2 type star. Finally, the effect of disc truncation due
to the presence of a companion star is investigated and we find that this has a
minimal effect on the average AMLR.
