 While the temperature of the X-ray corona ($\rm{kT_e}$) in active galactic
nuclei (AGN) are known for many sources, its variation, if any, is limited to a
handful of objects. This is in part due to the requirement of good
signal-to-noise X-ray spectra covering a wide range of energies. We present
here results on the X-ray spectral analysis of 18 Seyferts, having more than
one epoch of observations to look for variation in $\rm{kT_e}$. The data for a
total of 52 epochs on these 18 AGN were taken from observations carried out by
NuSTAR in the 3$-$79 keV energy band. From phenomenological and physical model
fits to the multi-epoch data on these 18 sources from {\it NuSTAR}, we could
constrain the cut-off energy ($E_{cut}$) in a large fraction of the sources.
Also, from Comptonized model fits, we could obtain $\rm{kT_e}$ for our sample.
Of the 18 sources, at the 90 per cent confidence level, evidence for variation
in $\rm{kT_e}$ was found for only one source, namely MCG+08-11-011. For this
source, between two epochs, separated by about five years, we found $\rm{kT_e}$
to decrease from 57$^{+29}_{-16}$ keV to 30$^{+11}_{-7}$ keV. During the same
period, the flux decreased from (12.60 to 14.02) $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the optical depth increased from 1.68 to 2.73. We thus
found a positive correlation between flux and coronal temperature with a
reduction of about 40 per cent in optical depth. Our observations tend to
favour the vertically outflowing corona scenario for the observed variation in
$\rm{kT_e}$ in MCG+08-11-011.
