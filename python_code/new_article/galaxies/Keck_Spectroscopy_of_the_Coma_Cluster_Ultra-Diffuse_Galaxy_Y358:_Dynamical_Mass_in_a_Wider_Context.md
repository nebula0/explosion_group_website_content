 We examine ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and their relation to non-UDGs in
mass-radius-luminosity space. We begin by publishing Keck/KCWI spectroscopy for
the Coma cluster UDG Y358, for which we measure both a recessional velocity and
velocity dispersion. Our recessional velocity confirms association with the
Coma cluster and Y358's status as a UDG. From our velocity dispersion (19 $\pm$
3 km s$^{-1}$) we calculate a dynamical mass within the half-light radius which
provides evidence for a core in Y358's dark matter halo. We compare this
dynamical mass, along with those for globular cluster (GC)-rich/-poor UDGs in
the literature, to mass profiles for isolated, gas-rich UDGs and UDGs in the
NIHAO/FIRE simulations. We find GC-poor UDGs have dynamical masses similar to
isolated, gas-rich UDGs, suggesting an evolutionary pathway may exist between
the two. Conversely, GC-rich UDGs have dynamical masses too massive to be
easily explained as the evolution of the isolated, gas-rich UDGs. The simulated
UDGs match the dynamical masses of the GC-rich UDGs. However, once compared in
stellar mass -- halo mass space, the FIRE/NIHAO simulated UDGs do not match the
halo masses of either the isolated, gas-rich UDGs or the GC-rich UDGs at the
same stellar mass. Finally, we supplement our data for Y358 with other UDGs
that have measured velocity dispersions in the literature. We compare this
sample to a wide range of non-UDGs in mass-radius-luminosity space, finding
UDGs have a similar locus to non-UDGs of similar luminosity with the primary
difference being their larger half-light radii.
