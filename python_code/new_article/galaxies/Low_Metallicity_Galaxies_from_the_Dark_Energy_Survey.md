 We present a new selection of 358 blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) from
5,000 square degrees in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the spectroscopic
follow-up of a subsample of 68 objects. For the subsample of 34 objects with
deep spectra, we measure the metallicity via the direct T$_e$ method using the
auroral [\oiii]$\lambda$ 4363 emission line. These BCDs have average oxygen
abundance of 12+log(O/H)= 7.8, stellar masses between 10$^7$ to 10$^8$
M$_\odot$ and specific SFR between $\sim$ 10$^{-9}$ to 10$^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$. We
compare the position of our BCDs with the Mass-metallicity (M-Z) and
Luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) relation derived from the Local Volume Legacy
sample. We find the scatter around the M-Z relation is smaller than the scatter
around the L-Z relation. We identify a correlation between the offsets from the
M-Z and L-Z relation that we suggest is due to the contribution of metal-poor
inflows. Finally, we explore the validity of the mass-metallicity-SFR
fundamental plane in the mass range probed by our galaxies. We find that BCDs
with stellar masses smaller than $10^{8}$M$_{\odot}$ do not follow the
extrapolation of the fundamental plane. This result suggests that mechanisms
other than the balance between inflows and outflows may be at play in
regulating the position of low mass galaxies in the M-Z-SFR space.
