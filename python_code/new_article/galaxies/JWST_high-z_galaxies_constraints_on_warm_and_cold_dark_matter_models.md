 We compare properties of high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST with
hydrodynamical simulations, in the standard cold dark matter model and in warm
dark matter models with a suppressed linear matter power spectrum. We find that
current data are not in tension with cold dark matter nor with warm dark matter
models with mWDM > 2 keV, since they probe bright and rare objects whose
physical properties are similar in the different scenarios. We also show how
two observables, the galaxy luminosity functions and the galaxy correlation
function at small scales of faint objects, can be promising tools for
discriminating between the different dark matter models.
