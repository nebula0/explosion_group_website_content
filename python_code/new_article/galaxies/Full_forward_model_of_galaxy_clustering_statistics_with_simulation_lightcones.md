 Novel summary statistics beyond the standard 2-point correlation function
(2PCF) are necessary to capture the full astrophysical and cosmological
information from the small-scale ($r < 30h^{-1}$Mpc) galaxy clustering.
However, the analysis of beyond-2PCF statistics on small scales is challenging
because we lack the appropriate treatment of observational systematics for
arbitrary summary statistics of the galaxy field. In this paper, we develop a
full forward modeling pipeline for any summary statistics using high-fidelity
simulation lightcones that accounts for all observational systematics and is
appropriate for a wide range of summary statistics. We apply our forward model
approach to a fully realistic mock galaxy catalog and demonstrate that we can
recover unbiased constraints on the underlying galaxy--halo connection model
using two separate summary statistics: the standard 2PCF and the novel $k$-th
nearest neighbor ($k$NN) statistics, which are sensitive to correlation
functions of all orders. We expect that applying this forward model approach to
current and upcoming surveys while leveraging a multitude of summary statistics
will become a powerful technique in maximally extracting information from the
non-linear scales.
