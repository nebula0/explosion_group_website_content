 We study the evolution of kinematically-defined stellar discs in 10
Fornax-like clusters identified in the TNG50 run from the IllustrisTNG suite of
cosmological simulations. We considered disc galaxies with present-day stellar
mass $M_{\star}\geq 3 \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ and follow their evolution since
first entering their host cluster. Very few stellar discs survive since falling
in such dense environments, ranging from 40% surviving to all being disrupted.
Such survival rates are consistent with what reported earlier for the two more
massive, Virgo-like clusters in TNG50. In absolute terms, however, the low
number of present-day disc galaxies in Fornax-like clusters could be at odds
with the presence of three edge-on disc galaxies in the central regions of the
actual Fornax cluster, as delineated by the Fornax3D survey. When looking at
the Fornax analogues from random directions and with the same selection
function of Fornax3D, the probability of finding three edge-on disc galaxies in
any one Fornax-like cluster in TNG50 is rather low, albeit not impossible. We
also compared the stellar-population properties near the equatorial plane
derived from integral-field spectroscopy for the three edge-ons in Fornax to
similar line-of-sight integrated values for present-day disc galaxies in TNG50.
For one of these, the very old and metal-rich stellar population of its disc
cannot be matched by any the disc galaxies in TNG50, including objects in the
field. We discuss possible interpretations of these findings, while pointing to
future studies on passive cluster spirals as a way to further test
state-of-the-art cosmological simulations.
