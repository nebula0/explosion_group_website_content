 We present the first detection of the [N II] 122 $\mu$m and [O III] 52 $\mu$m
lines for a reionisation-epoch galaxy. Based on these lines and previous [C II]
158 $\mu$m and [O III] 88 $\mu$m measurements, we estimate an electron density
of $\lesssim$ 500 cm$^{-3}$ and a gas-phase metallicity $Z/Z_\odot \sim 1.1 \pm
0.2$ for A1689-zD1, a gravitationally-lensed, dusty galaxy at $z$ = 7.133.
Other measurements or indicators of metallicity so far in galaxy ISMs at $z
\gtrsim$ 6 are typically an order of magnitude lower than this. The unusually
high metallicity makes A1689-zD1 inconsistent with the fundamental metallicity
relation, although there is likely significant dust obscuration of the stellar
mass, which may partly resolve the inconsistency. Given a solar metallicity,
the dust-to-metals ratio is a factor of several lower than expected, hinting
that galaxies beyond $z \sim$ 7 may have lower dust formation efficiency.
Finally, the inferred nitrogen enrichment compared to oxygen, on which the
metallicity measurement depends, indicates that star-formation in the system is
older than about 250 Myr, pushing the beginnings of this galaxy to $z >$ 10.
