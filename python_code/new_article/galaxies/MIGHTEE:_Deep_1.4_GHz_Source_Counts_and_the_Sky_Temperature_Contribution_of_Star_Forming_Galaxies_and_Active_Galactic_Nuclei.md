 We present deep 1.4 GHz source counts from $\sim$5 deg$^2$ of the continuum
Early Science data release of the MeerKAT International Gigahertz Tiered
Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey down to $S_{1.4\textrm{GHz}}\sim$15
$\mu$Jy. Using observations over two extragalactic fields (COSMOS and XMM-LSS),
we provide a comprehensive investigation into correcting the incompleteness of
the raw source counts within the survey to understand the true underlying
source count population. We use a variety of simulations that account for:
errors in source detection and characterisation, clustering, and variations in
the assumed source model used to simulate sources within the field and
characterise source count incompleteness. We present these deep source count
distributions and use them to investigate the contribution of extragalactic
sources to the sky background temperature at 1.4 GHz using a relatively large
sky area. We then use the wealth of ancillary data covering{a subset of the
COSMOS field to investigate the specific contributions from both active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and star forming galaxies (SFGs) to the source counts and
sky background temperature. We find, similar to previous deep studies, that we
are unable to reconcile the sky temperature observed by the ARCADE 2
experiment. We show that AGN provide the majority contribution to the sky
temperature contribution from radio sources, but the relative contribution of
SFGs rises sharply below 1 mJy, reaching an approximate 15-25% contribution to
the total sky background temperature ($T_b\sim$100 mK) at $\sim$15 $\mu$Jy.
