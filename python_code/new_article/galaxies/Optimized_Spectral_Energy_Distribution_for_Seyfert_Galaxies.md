 The temperature predicted by photoionization models for the Narrow Line
Region of Seyfert 2 galaxies is lower than the value inferred from the observed
[O III] {\lambda}4363A/{\lambda}5007A line ratio. We explore the possibility of
considering a harder ionizing continuum than typically assumed. The spectral
ionizing energy distribution, which can generate the observed
{\lambda}4363A/{\lambda}5007A ratio, is characterized by a secondary continuum
peak at 200 eV.
