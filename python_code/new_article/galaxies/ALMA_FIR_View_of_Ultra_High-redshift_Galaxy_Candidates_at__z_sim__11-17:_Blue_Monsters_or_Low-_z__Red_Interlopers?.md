 We present ALMA Band 7 observations of a remarkably bright galaxy candidate
at $z_{\rm phot}$=$16.7^{+1.9}_{-0.3}$ ($M_{\rm UV}$=$-21.6$), S5-z17-1,
identified in JWST Early Release Observation data of Stephen's Quintet. We do
not detect the dust continuum at 866 $\mu$m, ruling out the possibility that
S5-z17-1 is a low-$z$ dusty starburst with a star-formation rate (SFR) of
$\gtrsim 30\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We detect a 5.1$\sigma$ line feature at
$338.726\pm0.007$ GHz exactly coinciding with the JWST source position, with a
2% likelihood of the signal being spurious. The most likely line identification
would be [OIII]52$\mu$m at $z=16.01$ or [CII]158$\mu$m at $z=4.61$, whose line
luminosities do not violate the non-detection of the dust continuum in both
cases. Together with three other $z\gtrsim$ 11-13 candidate galaxies recently
observed with ALMA, we conduct a joint ALMA and JWST spectral energy
distribution (SED) analysis and find that the high-$z$ solution at $z\sim$11-17
is favored in every candidate as a very blue (UV continuum slope of
$\approx-2.3$) and luminous ($M_{\rm UV}$ $\approx$ [$-$24:$-$21]) system.
Still, we find in some candidates that reasonable SED fits ($\Delta$
$\chi^{2}\lesssim4$) are reproduced by type-II quasar and/or quiescent galaxy
templates with strong emission lines at $z\sim3$-5, where such populations
predicted from their luminosity functions and EW([OIII]+H$\beta$) distributions
are abundant in the survey volumes used for the $z\sim$11-17 candidates. While
these recent ALMA observation results have strengthened the likelihood of the
high-$z$ solutions, lower-$z$ possibilities are not completely ruled out in
some of the $z\sim$11-17 candidates.
