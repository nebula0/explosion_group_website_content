 Understanding quenching mechanisms in low-mass galaxies is essential for
understanding galaxy evolution overall. In particular, isolated galaxies are
important tools to help disentangle the complex internal and external processes
that impact star formation. Comparisons between quenched field and satellite
galaxies in the low mass regime offer a substantial opportunity for discovery,
although very few quenched galaxies with masses below $M_{\star}$$\sim$$10^{9}
M_{\odot}$ are known outside the virial radius, $R_{vir}$, of any host halo.
Importantly, simulations and observations suggest that an in-between population
of backsplash galaxies also exists that may complement interpretations of
environmental quenching. Backsplash galaxies -- like field galaxies -- reside
outside the virial radius of a host halo, but their star formation can be
deeply impacted by previous interactions with more massive systems. In this
paper, we report the discovery of a low-mass ($M_{\star}$$\sim$$10^{7}
M_{\odot}$) quenched galaxy approximately $1 R_{vir}$ in projection from the
M81 group. We use surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) to investigate the
possibility that the new galaxy, dubbed dw0910p7326 (nicknamed Blobby), is a
backsplash galaxy or a more distant field galaxy. The measured SBF distance of
$3.21\substack{+0.15 +0.41 \\ -0.15 -0.36}$ Mpc indicates that Blobby likely
lies between $1.0 < R/R_{vir} < 2.7$ outside the combined M81--M82 system.
Given its distance and quiescence, Blobby is a good candidate for a backsplash
galaxy and could provide hints about the formation and evolution of these
interesting objects.
