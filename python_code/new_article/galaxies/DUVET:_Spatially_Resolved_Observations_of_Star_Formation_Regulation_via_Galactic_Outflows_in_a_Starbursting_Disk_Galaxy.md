 We compare 500~pc scale, resolved observations of ionised and molecular gas
for the $z\sim0.02$ starbursting disk galaxy IRAS08339+6517, using measurements
from KCWI and NOEMA. We explore the relationship of the star formation driven
ionised gas outflows with colocated galaxy properties. We find a roughly linear
relationship between the outflow mass flux ($\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out}$) and star
formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), $\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm
out}\propto\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{1.06\pm0.10}$, and a strong correlation between
$\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out}$ and the gas depletion time, such that
$\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out} \propto t_{dep}^{-1.1\pm0.06}$. Moreover, we find these
outflows are so-called ``breakout" outflows, according to the relationship
between the gas fraction and disk kinematics. Assuming that ionised outflow
mass scales with total outflow mass, our observations suggest that the regions
of highest $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ in IRAS08 are removing more gas via the outflow
than through the conversion of gas into stars. Our results are consistent with
a picture in which the outflow limits the ability for a region of a disk to
maintain short depletion times. Our results underline the need for resolved
observations of outflows in more galaxies.
