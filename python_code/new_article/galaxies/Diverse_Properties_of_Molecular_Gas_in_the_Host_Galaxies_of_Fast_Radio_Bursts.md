 We report the properties of molecular gas in a sample of six host galaxies of
fast radio bursts (FRBs) obtained from CO observations with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (FRBs 20180924B, 20190102C, and 20190711A) and
results of one non-detection in a dwarf galaxy (FRB20121102A) and two events
detected in M81 (FRB20200120E) and the Milky Way (FRB20200428A). The CO
observations resulted in the detection of CO(3-2) emission in the FRB20180924B
host and non-detections of CO(3-2) and CO(2-1) emission in the hosts of
FRB20190102C and FRB20190711A, respectively. The derived molecular gas mass and
3$\sigma$ upper limit is $(2.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^9$ $M_{\odot}$, $<3.8 \times
10^8$ $M_{\odot}$, and $<6.7 \times 10^9$ $M_{\odot}$ for the hosts of
FRB20180924B, FRB20190102C, and FRB20190711A, respectively. We found diversity
in molecular gas properties (gas mass, gas depletion time, and gas fraction to
stellar mass) in the sample. Compared to other star-forming galaxies, the
FRB20180924B host is gas-rich (the larger molecular gas fraction), and the
hosts of FRB20190102C and FRB20200120E are gas-poor with a shorter depletion
time for their stellar mass and star-formation rate. Our findings suggest that
FRBs arise from multiple progenitors or single progenitors that can exist in a
wide range of galaxy environments. Statistical analysis shows a significant
difference in the distribution of molecular gas fraction between the FRB hosts
and local star-forming galaxies. However, the difference is not substantial
when an outlier, the FRB20200120E host, is excluded, and analysis with a larger
sample is needed.
