 The origin of star-formation in customarily passively evolving early-type
massive galaxies is poorly understood. We present a case study of a massive
galaxy, I~Zw~81, inside the Bootes void. The void galaxy is known to host an
active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our detailed 2D decomposition of the surface
brightness distribution in the $Canada$ $France$ $Hawaii$ $Telescope$ ($CFHT$)
g- and r-bands revealed multiple structural components such as a nuclear point
source, a bar, a ring, and an inner exponential disk followed by an outer low
surface brightness (LSB) disk. I~Zw~81 turns out to be a disk-dominated galaxy
with lenticular morphology. The modelling of the multi-wavelength spectral
energy distribution (SED) shows that the galaxy is star-forming (SF), and
belongs to the blue cloud. We find that the optical (g$-$r) color of the bar is
bluer than the disks, and the far- and near-ultraviolet emission inside the
galaxy observed with Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard {\em
AstroSat} is concentrated in the central few kpc region enclosing the bar. The
strong bar might be playing a pivotal role in driving the gas inflow and
causing SF activity in tandem with the minor merger-like interactions as
evident from the deep $CFHT$ data. The low-luminosity AGN is insufficient to
quench the central SF. The results are peculiar from the standpoint of a
massive barred lenticular galaxy.
