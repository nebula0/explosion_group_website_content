 The main interest of the Science Team for the exploitation of the MEGARA
instrument at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC hereafter) is devoted to
the study of nearby galaxies, with focus on the research of the history of star
formation, and chemical and kinematical properties of disc systems. We refer to
this project as MEGADES: MEGARA Galaxy Discs Evolution Survey. The initial goal
of MEGADES is to provide a detailed study of the inner regions of nearby disc
galaxies, both in terms of their spectrophotometric and chemical evolution, and
their dynamical characterisation, by disentangling the contribution of in-situ
and ex-situ processes to the history of star formation and effective chemical
enrichment of these regions. In addition, the dynamical analysis of these inner
regions naturally includes the identification and characterization of galactic
winds potentially present in these regions. At a later stage, we will extend
this study further out in galactocentric distance. The first stage of this
project encompasses the analysis of the central regions of a total of 43 nearby
galaxies observed with the MEGARA Integral Field Unit for 114 hours, including
both Guaranteed Time and Open Time observations. In this paper we provide a set
of all the processed data products available to the community and early results
from the analysis of these data regarding stellar continuum, ionized and
neutral gas features.
