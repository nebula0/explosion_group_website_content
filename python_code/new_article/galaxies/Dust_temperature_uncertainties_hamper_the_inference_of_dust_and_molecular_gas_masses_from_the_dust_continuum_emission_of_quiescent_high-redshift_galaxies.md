 Single flux density measurements at observed-frame sub-millimeter and
millimeter wavelengths are commonly used to probe dust and gas masses in
galaxies. In this Letter, we explore the robustness of this method to infer
dust mass, focusing on quiescent galaxies, using a series of controlled
experiments on four massive haloes from the Feedback in Realistic Environments
(FIRE) project. Our starting point is four star-forming, central galaxies at
seven redshifts between z=1.5 and z=4.5. We generate modified quiescent
galaxies that have been quenched for 100Myr, 500Myr, or 1Gyr prior to each of
the studied redshifts by re-assigning stellar ages. We derive spectral energy
distributions for each fiducial and modified galaxy using radiative transfer.
We demonstrate that the dust mass inferred is highly dependent on the assumed
dust temperature, T_dust, which is often unconstrained observationally.
Motivated by recent work on quiescent galaxies that assumed T_dust~25K, we show
that the ratio between dust mass and 1.3mm flux density can be higher than
inferred by up to an order of magnitude, due to the considerably lower dust
temperatures seen in non star-forming galaxies. This can lead to an
underestimation of dust mass (and, when sub-mm flux density is used as a proxy
for molecular gas content, gas mass). This underestimation is most severe at
higher redshifts, where the observed-frame 1.3mm flux density probes rest-frame
wavelengths far from the Rayleigh-Jeans regime, and hence depends
super-linearly on dust temperature. We fit relations between ratios of
rest-frame far-infrared flux densities and mass-weighted dust temperature that
can be used to constrain dust temperatures from observations and hence derive
more reliable dust and molecular gas masses.
