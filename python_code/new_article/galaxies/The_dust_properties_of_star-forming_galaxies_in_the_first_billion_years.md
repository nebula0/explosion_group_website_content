 The Atacama Large Millimetre/Sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) is obtaining the
deepest observations of early galaxies ever achieved at (sub-)millimetre
wavelengths, and detecting the dust emission of young galaxies in the first
billion years of cosmic history, well in the epoch of reionization. Here I
review some of the latest results from these observations, with special focus
on the REBELS large programme, which targets a sample of 40 star-forming
galaxies at z~7. ALMA detects significant amounts of dust in very young
galaxies, and this dust might have different properties to dust in
lower-redshift galaxies. I describe the evidence for this, and discuss
theoretical/modelling efforts to explain the dust properties of these young
galaxies. Finally, I describe two additional surprising results to come out of
the REBELS survey: (i) a new population of completely dust-obscured galaxies at
z~7, and (ii) the prevalence of spatial offsets between the ultraviolet and
infrared emission of UV-bright, high-redshift star-forming galaxies.
