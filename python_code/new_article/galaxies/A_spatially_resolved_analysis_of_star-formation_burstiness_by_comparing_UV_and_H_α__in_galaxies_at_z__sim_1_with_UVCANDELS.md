 The UltraViolet imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep
Extragalactic Legacy Survey Fields (UVCANDELS) program provides HST/UVIS F275W
imaging for four CANDELS fields. We combine this UV imaging with existing
HST/near-IR grism spectroscopy from 3D-HST+AGHAST to directly compare the
resolved rest-frame UV and H$\alpha$ emission for a sample of 979 galaxies at
$0.7<z<1.5$ spanning a range in stellar mass of $10^{8-11.5}~M_\odot$. Since
both rest-UV and H$\alpha$ are sensitive to on-going star-formation but over
different timescales, their resolved comparison allows us to infer the
burstiness in star-formation as a function of galaxy structural parameters. We
generate homogenized maps of rest-UV and H$\alpha$ emission for all galaxies in
our sample and stack them to compute the average UV-to-H$\alpha$ luminosity
ratio as a function of galactocentric radius. We find that galaxies below
stellar mass of $\sim10^{9.5}~M_\odot$, at all radii, have a UV-to-H$\alpha$
ratio higher than the equilibrium value expected from constant star-formation,
indicating a significant contribution from bursty star-formation. Even for
galaxies with stellar mass $\gtrsim10^{9.5} M_\odot$, the UV-to-H$\alpha$ ratio
is elevated towards in their outskirts ($R/R_{eff}>1.5$), suggesting that
bursty star-formation is likely prevalent in the outskirts of even the most
massive galaxies but is likely over-shadowed by their brighter cores.
Furthermore, we present the UV-to-H$\alpha$ ratio as a function of galaxy
surface brightness, a proxy for stellar mass surface density, and find that
regions below $\sim10^8~M_\odot~kpc^{-2}$ are consistent with bursty
star-formation, regardless of their galaxy stellar mass, potentially suggesting
that local star-formation is independent of global galaxy properties at the
smallest scales.
