 We report the discovery of a very rare phenomenon, a multiply-imaged
gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia), "SN Zwicky", a.k.a. SN
2022qmx, magnified nearly twenty-five times by a foreground galaxy. The system
was identified as intrinsically bright thanks to the "standard candle" nature
of SNe Ia. Observations with high-spatial resolution instruments resolved a
system with four nearly simultaneous images, with an Einstein radius of only
$\theta_E =0.167"$, corresponding to a lens mass of $8\cdot 10^9$ solar masses
within a physical size below $0.8$ kiloparsecs. A smooth lens model fails to
reproduce the image flux ratios, suggesting significant additional
magnification from compact objects. Given the small image splitting and a
relatively faint deflecting galaxy, the lensing system would not have been
found through the angular separation technique generally used in large imaging
surveys.
