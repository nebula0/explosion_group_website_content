 We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of 14 gas-rich, low surface
brightness and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the field at distances of 25-36
Mpc. An inspection of point-like sources brighter than the turnover magnitude
of the globular cluster luminosity function and within twice the half-light
radii of each galaxy reveals that, unlike those in denser environments,
gas-rich, field UDGs host very few old globular clusters (GCs). Most of the
targets (nine) have zero candidate GCs, with the remainder having one or two
candidates each. These findings are broadly consistent with expectations for
normal dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass. This rules out gas-rich, field
UDGs as potential progenitors of the GC-rich UDGs that are typically found in
galaxy clusters. However, some in galaxy groups may be directly accreted from
the field. In line with other recent results, this strongly suggests that there
must be at least two distinct formation pathways for UDGs, and that this
sub-population is simply an extreme low surface brightness extension of the
underlying dwarf galaxy population. The root cause of their diffuse stellar
distributions remains unclear, but the formation mechanism appears to only
impact the distribution of stars (and potentially dark matter), without
strongly impacting the distribution of neutral gas, the overall stellar mass,
or the number of GCs.
