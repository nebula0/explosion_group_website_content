 We investigate dust-unbiased star formation rates (SFR) as a function of the
environment in 20 massive clusters ($M_{200}>4\times10^{14} {\rm M}_{\odot}$)
between $0.15<z<0.35$ using radio luminosities ($L_{\rm 1.4GHz}$) from the
recently released MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey catalogue. We use
optical data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey to estimate photo-$z$s
and assign cluster membership. We observe a steady decline in the fraction
($f_{\rm SF}$) of star-forming galaxies from $2R_{200}$ to the cluster centres
in our full cluster sample, but notice a significant difference in $f_{\rm SF}$
gradients between clusters hosting large-scale extended radio emission in the
form of haloes and relics (associated with ongoing merger activity) and
non-radio-halo/relic hosting clusters. For star-forming galaxies within
$R_{200}$, the $f_{\rm SF}$ in clusters hosting radio haloes and relics
($0.148\pm0.016$) is $\approx23\%$ higher than in non-radio-halo/relic hosting
clusters ($0.120\pm0.011$). We observe a $3\sigma$ difference between the total
SFR normalised by cluster mass for non-radio-halo/relic hosting clusters
($21.5\pm1.9$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$/$10^{14}$M$_{\odot}$) and for clusters with
radio haloes and relics ($26.1\pm1.4$
M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$/$10^{14}$M$_{\odot}$). There is a $\approx4\times$ decline
in the mass normalised total SFR of clusters for galaxies with SFR above the
luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) SFR limit at our redshift slice,
corresponding to 2 Gyr in look-back time. This is consistent with the rapid
decline in SF activity with decreasing redshift amongst cluster LIRGs seen by
previous studies using infrared-derived SFR.
