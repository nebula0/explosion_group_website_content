 We present a catalogue of 4499 groups and clusters of galaxies from the first
data release of the multi-filter (5 broad, 7 narrow) Southern Photometric Local
Universe Survey (S-PLUS). These groups and clusters are distributed over 273
deg$^2$ in the Stripe 82 region. They are found using the PzWav algorithm,
which identifies peaks in galaxy density maps that have been smoothed by a
cluster scale difference-of-Gaussians kernel to isolate clusters and groups.
Using a simulation-based mock catalogue, we estimate the purity and
completeness of cluster detections: at S/N>3.3 we define a catalogue that is
80% pure and complete in the redshift range 0.1<z<0.4, for clusters with
$M_{200} > 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We also assessed the accuracy of the catalogue
in terms of central positions and redshifts, finding scatter of $\sigma_R=12$
kpc and $\sigma_z=8.8 \times 10^{-3}$, respectively. Moreover, less than 1% of
the sample suffers from fragmentation or overmerging. The S-PLUS cluster
catalogue recovers ~80% of all known X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected
clusters in this field. This fraction is very close to the estimated
completeness, thus validating the mock data analysis and paving an efficient
way to find new groups and clusters of galaxies using data from the ongoing
S-PLUS project. When complete, S-PLUS will have surveyed 9300 deg$^{2}$ of the
sky, representing the widest uninterrupted areas with narrow-through-broad
multi-band photometry for cluster follow-up studies.
