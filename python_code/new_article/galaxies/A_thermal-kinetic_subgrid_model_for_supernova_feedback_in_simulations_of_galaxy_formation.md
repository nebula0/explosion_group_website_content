 We present a subgrid model for supernova feedback designed for simulations of
galaxy formation. The model uses thermal and kinetic channels of energy
injection, which are built upon the stochastic kinetic and thermal models for
stellar feedback used in the OWLS and EAGLE simulations, respectively. In the
thermal channel, the energy is distributed statistically isotropically and
injected stochastically in large amounts per event, which minimizes spurious
radiative energy losses. In the kinetic channel, we inject the energy in small
portions by kicking gas particles in pairs in opposite directions. The
implementation of kinetic feedback is designed to conserve energy, linear
momentum and angular momentum, and is statistically isotropic. To test and
validate the model, we run simulations of isolated Milky Way-mass and dwarf
galaxies, in which the gas is allowed to cool down to 10 K. Using the thermal
and kinetic channels together, we obtain smooth star formation histories and
powerful galactic winds with realistic mass loading factors. Furthermore, the
model produces spatially resolved star formation rates and velocity dispersions
that are in agreement with observations. We vary the numerical resolution by
several orders of magnitude and find excellent convergence of the global star
formation rates and the mass loading of galactic winds. We show that large
thermal-energy injections generate a hot phase of the interstellar medium (ISM)
and modulate the star formation by ejecting gas from the disc, while the
low-energy kicks increase the turbulent velocity dispersion in the neutral ISM,
which in turn helps suppress star formation.
