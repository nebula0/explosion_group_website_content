 We investigate the connection of the regulation of star formation and the
cycling of baryons within and in and out of galaxies. We use idealized
numerical simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, in which we systemically vary
the galaxy morphology (bulge-to-total mass ratio) and stellar feedback strength
(total eight setups with 80 simulations). By following individual gas parcels
through the disk, spiral arms, and massive star-forming clumps, we quantify how
gas moves and oscillates through the different phases of the interstellar
medium (ISM) and forms stars. We show that the residence time of gas in the
dense ISM phase ($\tau_{\rm SF}$), the nature of spiral arms (strength,
number), and the clump properties (number, mass function, and young star
fraction) depend on both the galaxy morphology and stellar feedback. Based on
these results, we quantify signatures of the baryon cycle within galaxies using
the temporal and spatial power spectrum density (PSD) of the star formation
history (SFH). Stronger stellar feedback leads to more bursty star formation
while the correlation timescale of the SFH is longer, because stronger feedback
dissolves the dense, star-forming ISM phase, leading to a more homogeneous ISM
and a decrease in $\tau_{\rm SF}$. The bulge strength has a similar effect: the
deep gravitational potential in a bulge-dominant galaxy imposes a strong shear
force that effectively breaks apart gas clumps in the ISM; this subsequently
inhibits the fragmentation of cool gas and therefore the star formation in the
disk, leading to a decrease in the spatial power on scales of $\sim$ 1 kpc. We
conclude that measurements of the temporal and spatial PSD of the SFH can
provide constraints on the baryon cycle and the star formation process.
