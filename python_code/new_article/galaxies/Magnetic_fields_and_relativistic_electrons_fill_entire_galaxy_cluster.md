 The hot plasma within merging galaxy clusters is predicted to be filled with
shocks and turbulence that may convert part of their kinetic energy into
relativistic electrons and magnetic fields generating synchrotron radiation.
Analyzing Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations of the galaxy cluster Abell
2255, we show evidence of radio synchrotron emission distributed over very
large scales of at least 5 megaparsec. The pervasive radio emission witnesses
that shocks and turbulence efficiently transfer kinetic energy into
relativistic particles and magnetic fields in a region that extends up to the
cluster outskirts. The strength of the emission requires a magnetic field
energy density at least 100 times higher than expected from a simple
compression of primordial fields, presumably implying that dynamo operates
efficiently also in the cluster periphery. It also suggests that nonthermal
components may contribute substantially to the pressure of the intracluster
medium in the cluster periphery.
