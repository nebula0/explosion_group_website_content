 NGC 1266 is a lenticular galaxy (S0) hosting an active galactic nucleus
(AGN), and known to contain a large amount of shocked gas. We compare the
luminosity ratio of mid-\emph{J} CO lines to IR continuum with star-forming
galaxies (SFGs), and then model the CO spectral line energy distribution
(SLED). We confirm that in the mid- and high-\emph{J} regions ($J_{\rm up}$ =
4--13), the C-type shock ($v_{\rm s}$ = 25 km s$^{-1}$, $n_{\rm H}$ =
$5\times10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$) can reproduce the CO observations well. The galaxy
spectral energy distribution (SED) is constructed and modeled by the code {\tt
X-CIGALE} and obtains a set of physical parameters including the star formation
rate (SFR, 1.17 $\pm$ 0.47 \emph{M$_{\odot}$}yr$^{-1}$). Also, our work
provides SFR derivation of [C\,{\sc ii}] from the neutral hydrogen regions only
(1.38 $\pm$ 0.14 $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$). Previous studies have illusive
conclusions on the AGN or starburst nature of the NGC 1266 nucleus. Our SED
model shows that the hidden AGN in the system is intrinsically low-luminosity,
consequently the infrared luminosity of the AGN does not reach the expected
level. Archival data from \emph{NuSTAR} hard X-ray observations in the 3--79
keV band shows a marginal detection, disfavoring presence of an obscured
luminous AGN and implying that a compact starburst is more likely dominant for
the NGC 1266 nucleus.
