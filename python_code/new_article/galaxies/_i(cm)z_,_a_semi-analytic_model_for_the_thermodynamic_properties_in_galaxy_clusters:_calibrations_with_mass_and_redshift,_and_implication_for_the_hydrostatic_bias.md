 In the self-similar scenario for galaxy cluster formation and evolution, the
thermodynamic properties of the X-ray emitting plasma can be predicted in their
dependencies on the halo mass and redshift only. However, several departures
from this simple self-similar scenario have been observed. We show how our
semi-analytic model $i(cm)z$, that modifies the self-similar predictions
through two temperature-dependent quantities --the gas mass fraction $f_g = f_0
T^{f_1} E_z^{f_z}$ and the temperature variation $f_T = t_0 T^{t_1}
E_z^{t_z}$--, can be calibrated to incorporate the mass and redshift
dependencies. We use a published set of 17 scaling relations to constrain the
parameters of the model. Then, we are able to make predictions on the slope of
any observed scaling relation within a few per cent of the central value and
about one $\sigma$ of the nominal error. Contextually, also the evolution of
these scaling laws is determined, with predictions within $1.5 \sigma$ and
within 10 per cent of the observational constraints. Relying on this
calibration, we evaluate also the consistency of the predictions on the radial
profiles with some observational datasets. For a sample of high-quality data
(X-COP), we are able to constrain a further parameter of the model, the
hydrostatic bias $b$. By calibrating the model versus a large set of X-ray
scaling laws, we obtain that (i) the slopes of the temperature dependence are
$f_1 = 0.403 (\pm 0.009)$ and $t_1 = 0.144 (\pm 0.017)$; (ii) the dependence
upon $E_z$ are constrained to be $f_z = -0.004 (\pm 0.023)$ and $t_z = 0.349
(\pm 0.059)$. These values permit us to estimate directly how the
normalizations of a given quantity change as a function of the mass (or
temperature) and redshift halo in the form $Q_{\Delta} \sim M^{a_M} E_z^{a_z}
\sim T^{a_T} \, E_z^{a_{Tz}}$, in very good agreement with the current
observational constraints.
