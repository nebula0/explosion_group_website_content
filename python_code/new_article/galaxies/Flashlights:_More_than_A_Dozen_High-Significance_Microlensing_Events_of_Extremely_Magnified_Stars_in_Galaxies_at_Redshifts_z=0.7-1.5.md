 Once only accessible in nearby galaxies, we can now study individual stars
across much of the observable universe aided by galaxy-cluster gravitational
lenses. When a star, compact object, or multiple such objects in the foreground
galaxy-cluster lens become aligned, they can magnify a background individual
star, and the timescale of a magnification peak can limit its size to tens of
AU. The number and frequency of microlensing events therefore opens a window
into the population of stars and compact objects, as well as high-redshift
stars. To assemble the first statistical sample of stars in order to constrain
the initial mass function (IMF) of massive stars at redshift z=0.7-1.5, the
abundance of primordial black holes in galaxy-cluster dark matter, and the IMF
of the stars making up the intracluster light, we are carrying out a 192-orbit
program with the Hubble Space Telescope called "Flashlights," which is now
two-thirds complete owing to scheduling challenges. We use the ultrawide F200LP
and F350LP long-pass WFC3 UVIS filters and conduct two 16-orbit visits
separated by one year. Having an identical roll angle during both visits, while
difficult to schedule, yields extremely clean subtraction. Here we report the
discovery of more than a dozen bright microlensing events, including multiple
examples in the famous "Dragon Arc" discovered in the 1980s, as well as the
"Spocks" and "Warhol" arcs that have hosted already known supergiants. The
ultradeep observer-frame ultraviolet-through-optical imaging is sensitive to
hot stars, which will complement deep James Webb Space Telescope infrared
imaging. We are also acquiring Large Binocular Telescope LUCI and Keck-I
MOSFIRE near-infrared spectra of the highly magnified arcs to constrain their
recent star-formation histories.
