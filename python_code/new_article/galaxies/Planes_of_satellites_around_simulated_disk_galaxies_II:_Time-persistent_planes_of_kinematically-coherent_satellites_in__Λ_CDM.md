 We use two zoom-in $\Lambda$CDM hydrodynamical simulations of massive disk
galaxies to study the possible existence of fixed satellite groups showing a
kinematically-coherent behaviour across evolution (angular momentum
conservation and clustering). We identify three such groups in the two
simulations, defining kinematically-coherent, time-persistent planes (KPPs)
that last at least from virialization to $z=0$ (more than 7 Gyrs). This proves
that orbital pole clustering is not necessarily set in at low redshift,
representing a long-lived property of galaxy systems. KPPs are thin and oblate,
represent $\sim25-40\%$ of the total number of satellites in the system, and
are roughly perpendicular to their corresponding central disk galaxies during
certain periods, consistently with Milky Way $z=0$ data. KPP satellite members
are statistically distinguishable from satellites outside KPPs: they show
higher specific orbital angular momenta, orbit more perpendicularly to the
central disk galaxy, and have larger pericentric distances, than the latter. We
numerically prove, for the first time, that KPPs and the best-quality
positional planes share the same space configuration across time, such that
KPPs act as `skeletons' preventing the latter of being washed out in short
timescales. In one of the satellite-host systems, we witness the late capture
of a massive dwarf galaxy endowed with its own satellite system, also organized
into a KPP configuration prior to its capture. We briefly explore the
consequences this event has on the host's KPP, and on the possible enhancement
of the asymmetry in the number of satellites rotating in one sense or the
opposite within the KPP.
