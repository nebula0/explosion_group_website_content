 Removing optical and atmospheric blur from galaxy images significantly
improves galaxy shape measurements for weak gravitational lensing and galaxy
evolution studies. This ill-posed linear inverse problem is usually solved with
deconvolution algorithms enhanced by regularisation priors or deep learning. We
introduce a so-called "physics-based deep learning" approach to the Point
Spread Function (PSF) deconvolution problem in galaxy surveys. We apply
algorithm unrolling and the Plug-and-Play technique to the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with a Poisson noise model and use a
neural network to learn appropriate priors from simulated galaxy images. We
characterise the time-performance trade-off of several methods for galaxies of
differing brightness levels, showing an improvement of 26% (SNR=20)/48%
(SNR=100) compared to standard methods and 14% (SNR=20) compared to modern
methods.
