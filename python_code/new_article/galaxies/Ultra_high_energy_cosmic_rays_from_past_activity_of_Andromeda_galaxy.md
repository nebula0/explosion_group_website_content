 It is shown that the relativistic jets associated with the growth and past
activity of the supermassive black hole in the Andromeda galaxy could be the
main source of cosmic rays with energies above $10^{15}$ eV. Most of the cosmic
ray energy is related to a bow shock of the jet that produces multi-PeV cosmic
rays with light composition. The highest energy cosmic rays with heavy
composition are produced in the jet itself. The spectra of energetic particles
produced in Andromeda galaxy and propagated to the Earth are calculated and
compared with observations.
