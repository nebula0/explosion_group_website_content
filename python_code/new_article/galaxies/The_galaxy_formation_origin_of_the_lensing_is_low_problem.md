 It is now well-established that $\Lambda$CDM predictions overestimate
gravitational lensing measurements around massive galaxies by about 30%, the
so-called lensing is low problem. Using a state-of-the-art hydrodynamical
simulation, we show that this discrepancy reflects shortcomings in standard
structure formation models rather than tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm itself. Specifically, this problem results from ignoring a variety of
galaxy formation effects in simple models, including assembly bias, segregation
of satellite galaxies relative to dark matter, and baryonic effects on the
matter distribution. Each of these contributes towards overestimating
gravitational lensing and, when combined, these explain the amplitude and scale
dependence of the lensing is low problem. We conclude that simplistic structure
formation models are inadequate to interpret lensing and clustering together,
and that it is crucial to employ more sophisticated models for the upcoming
generation of large-scale surveys.
