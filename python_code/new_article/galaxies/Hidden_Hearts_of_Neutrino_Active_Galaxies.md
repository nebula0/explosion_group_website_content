 Recent multimessenger studies have provided evidence for high-energy neutrino
sources that are opaque to GeV-TeV gamma-rays. We investigate the connection
between high-energy neutrinos and gamma-rays in the active galaxy NGC 1068, and
find that the neutrinos most likely come from regions within about 100
Schwarzschild radii. This is especially the case if neutrinos are produced via
the photomeson production process, although the constraints could be alleviated
if hadronuclear interactions are dominant. We consider the most favorable
neutrino production regions, and discuss coronae, jets, winds, and their
interactions with dense material. The results strengthen the importance of
understanding dissipation mechanisms near the coronal region and the base of
outflows. There could be a connection between active galactic nuclei with
near-Eddington accretion and tidal disruptions events, in that neutrinos are
produced in the obscured vicinity of supermassive black holes.
