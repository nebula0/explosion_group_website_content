 The GRB 190829A has been widely studied due to its nature and the high energy
emission presented. Due to the detection of a very-high-energy component by the
High Energy Stereoscopic System and the event's atypically middling luminosity,
it has been categorized in a select, limited group of bursts bordering classic
GRBs and nearby sub-energetic events. Given the range of models utilized to
adequately characterize the afterglow of this burst, it has proven challenging
to identify the most probable explanation. Nevertheless, the detection of
polarization data provided by the MASTER collaboration has added a new aspect
to GRB 190829A that permits us to attempt to explore this degeneracy. In this
paper, we present a polarization model coupled with a synchrotron forward-shock
model -- a component in all models used to describe GRB 190829A's afterglow --
in order to fit the polarization's temporal evolution with the existing upper
limits ($\Pi < 6\%$). We find that the polarization generated from an on-axis
emission is favored for strongly anisotropic magnetic field ratios, while an
off-axis scenario cannot be fully ruled out when a more isotropic framework is
taken into account.
