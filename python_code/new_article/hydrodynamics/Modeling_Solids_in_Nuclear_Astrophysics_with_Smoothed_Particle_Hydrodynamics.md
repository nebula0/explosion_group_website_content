 Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a frequently applied tool in
computational astrophysics to solve the fluid dynamics equations governing the
systems under study. For some problems, for example when involving asteroids
and asteroid impacts, the additional inclusion of material strength is
necessary in order to accurately describe the dynamics. In compact stars, that
is white dwarfs and neutron stars, solid components are also present. Neutron
stars have a solid crust which is the strongest material known in nature.
However, their dynamical evolution, when modeled via SPH or other computational
fluid dynamics codes, is usually described as a purely fluid dynamics problem.
Here, we present the first 3D simulations of neutron-star crustal toroidal
oscillations including material strength with the Los Alamos National
Laboratory SPH code FleCSPH. In the first half of the paper, we present the
numerical implementation of solid material modeling together with standard
tests. The second half is on the simulation of crustal oscillations in the
fundamental toroidal mode. Here, we dedicate a large fraction of the paper to
approaches which can suppress numerical noise in the solid. If not minimized,
the latter can dominate the crustal motion in the simulations.
