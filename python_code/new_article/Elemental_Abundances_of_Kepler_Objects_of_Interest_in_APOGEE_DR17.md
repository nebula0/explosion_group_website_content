 The elemental abundances of planet host stars can shed light on the
conditions of planet forming environments. We test if individual abundances of
130 known/candidate planet hosts in APOGEE are statistically different from
those of a reference doppelganger sample. The reference set comprises objects
selected with the same Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [Mg/H] as each Kepler Object of
Interest (KOI). We predict twelve individual abundances (X = C, N, O, Na, Al,
Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni) for the KOIs and their doppelgangers using a local
linear model of these four parameters, training on ASPCAP abundance
measurements for a sample of field stars with high fidelity (SNR > 200) APOGEE
observations. We compare element prediction residuals (model-measurement) for
the two samples and find them to be indistinguishable, given a high quality
sample selection. We report median intrinsic dispersions of ~0.038 dex and
~0.041 dex, for the KOI and doppelganger samples, respectively, for these
elements. We conclude that the individual abundances at fixed Teff, logg,
[Fe/H], and [Mg/H] are unremarkable for known planet hosts. Our results
establish an upper limit on the abundance precision required to uncover any
chemical signatures of planet formation in planet host stars.
