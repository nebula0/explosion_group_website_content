 The 1.3deg (G1.3) and 1.6deg (G1.6) cloud complexes in the Central Molecular
Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy have been proposed to possibly reside at the
intersection region of the X1 and X2 orbits for several reasons. This includes
the detection of co-spatial low- and high-velocity clouds, high velocity
dispersion, high fractional molecular abundances of shock-tracing molecules,
and kinetic temperatures that are higher than for usual CMZ clouds. We mapped
both cloud complexes in molecular lines in the frequency range from 85 to
475GHz with the IRAM 30m and the APEX 12m telescopes. The kinematic structure
of G1.3 reveals an `emission bridge' at intermediate velocities (~150km/s)
connecting low-velocity (~100km/s) and high-velocity (~180km/s) gas and an
overall fluffy shell-like structure. These may represent observational evidence
of cloud-cloud interactions. Low- and high-velocity gas components in G1.6 do
not show such evidence of interaction, suggesting that they are spatially
separated. We selected three positions in each cloud complex for further
analysis. Based on non-LTE modelling of an ensemble of CH3CN lines, we derived
kinetic temperatures of 60-100K and H2 volume densities of 10$^4$-10$^5$cm-3 in
both complexes. Molecular abundances relative to H2 suggest a similar chemistry
of the two clouds, which is moreover similar to that of other GC clouds. We
conclude that G1.3 may indeed exhibit signs of cloud-cloud interactions. We
propose an interaction of gas that is accreted from the near-side dust lane to
the CMZ, with gas pre-existing at this location. Low- and high-velocity
components in G1.6 are rather coincidentally observed along the same line of
sight. They may be associated with either overshot decelerated gas from the
far-side dust line or actual CMZ gas and high-velocity gas moving on a dust
lane. These scenarios would be in agreement with numerical simulations.
