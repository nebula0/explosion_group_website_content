 We present a first systematic time series study of a sample of blazars
observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite $\textit{TESS}$
spacecraft. By cross matching the positions of the sources in the TESS
observations with those from Roma-BZCAT, 29 blazars including both BL Lacerate
objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars were identified. The observation
lengths of the 79 light curves of the sources, across all sectors on which the
targets of interest have been observed by $\textit{TESS}$, range between 21.25
and 28.2 days. The light curves were analyzed using various methods of time
series analysis. The results show that the sources exhibit significant
variability with fractional variability spanning between 1.41% and 53.84%. The
blazar flux distributions were studied by applying normal and lognormal
probability density function models. The results indicate that optical flux
histogram of the sources are consistent with normal probability density
function with most of them following bi-modal distribution as opposed to
uni-modal distribution. This suggests that the days-timescale optical
variability is contributed either by two different emission zones or two
distinct states of short-term activity in blazars. Power spectral density
analysis was performed by using the power spectral response method and the true
power spectra of unevenly sampled light curves were estimated. The power
spectral slopes of the light curves ranged from 1.7 to 3.2.
