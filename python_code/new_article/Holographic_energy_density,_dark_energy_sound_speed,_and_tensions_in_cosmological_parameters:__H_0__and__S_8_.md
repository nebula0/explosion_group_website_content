 Interesting discrepancies in cosmological parameters are challenging the
success of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Direct measurements of the Hubble constant
$H_0$ using Cepheid variables and supernovae turn out to be higher than
inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Weak galaxy lensing
surveys consistently report values of the strength of matter clustering
$\sigma_8$ lower than values derived from the CMB in the context of
$\Lambda$CDM. In this paper we address these discrepancies in cosmological
parameters by considering Dark Energy (DE) as a fluid with evolving equation of
state $w_{\mathrm{de}}(z)$, constant sound speed squared
$\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}$, and vanishing anisotropic stress $\sigma$. Our
$w_{\mathrm{de}}(z)$ is derived from the Holographic Principle and can
consecutively exhibit radiation-like, matter-like, and DE-like behaviour, thus
affecting the sound horizon and the comoving angular diameter distance, hence
$H_0$. Here we show DE sound speed plays a part in the matter clustering
behaviour through its effect on the evolution of the gravitational potential.
We compute cosmological constraints using several data set combinations
including primary CMB, CMB lensing, redshift-space-distortions, local
distance-ladder, supernovae, and baryon acoustic oscillations. In our analysis
we marginalise over $\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}$ and find
$\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}=1$ is excluded at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$. For our baseline
result including the whole data set we found $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ in good
agreement (within $\approx 2\sigma$) with low redshift probes. Our constraint
for the baryon energy density $\omega_{\rm{b}}$ is however in $\approx 3\sigma$
tension with BBN constraints. We conclude evolving DE also having non-standard
clustering properties [e.g., $\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}(z,k)$] might be relevant
for the solution of current discrepancies in cosmological parameters.
