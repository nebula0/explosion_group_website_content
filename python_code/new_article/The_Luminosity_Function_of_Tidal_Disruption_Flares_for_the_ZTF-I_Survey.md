 The high-cadence survey of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has completely
dominated the discovery of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in the past few years
and resulted in the largest sample of TDEs with optical/UV light curves
well-sampled around their peaks, providing us an excellent opportunity to
construct a peak luminosity function (LF) of tidal disruption flares (TDFs).
The new construction is necessary particularly considering that the most
updated LF reported in literature has been inferred from only 13 sources from 5
different surveys. Here we present the optical and blackbody LFs calculated by
33 TDFs discovered in the ZTF-I survey. The optical LF can be described by both
a power-law profile $dN/dL_g\propto L_g^{-2.3\pm0.2}$, and a Schechter-like
function. The blackbody LF can be described by a power-law profile $dN/dL_{\rm
bb}\propto L_{\rm bb}^{-2.2\pm0.2}$, shallower than the LF made of previous van
Velzen (2018) sample. A possible low-luminosity turnover in the optical LF
supports an Eddington-limited emission scenario. The drop of volumetric rate at
high luminosity suggests a rate suppression due to direct captures of the black
hole. The total volumetric rate is one order of magnitude lower than the
previous estimation, which is probably not simply caused by the high fraction
post-peak sources (7/13) in the previous sample. Instead, the normalization
step during the previous LF construction to reconcile various surveys might
adversely amplify the influence of serendipitous discoveries. Therefore, TDFs
selected from ongoing and upcoming uniform surveys like ZTF, Vera Rubin
Observatory (VRO) and Wide-Field Survey Telescope (WFST) should yield more
accurate LFs.
