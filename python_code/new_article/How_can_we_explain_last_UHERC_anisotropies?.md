 We consider the recent results on UHECR (Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray),
clustering, composition, distribution in the sky, from the energy of several
EeV with the dipole anisotropy up to the highest ones. We have suggested since
2008 and we reconfirm here that UHECR at 40 up to 70 EeV are mostly made by
light and lightest nuclei. The remarkable Virgo absence and the few localized
nearby extragalactic sources as CenA, NG 253, M82 may be well understood by the
lightest nuclei fragility and opacity within Mpc distances. We comment also on
the role of a few galactic UHECR sources at ten EeV that may be partially
feeding the Auger dipole UHECR anisotropy. The recent anisotropy in the UHECR
spectral composition of lightest and heavy nuclei, outside and along the
galactic plane, could also be a first confirmation of our previous claims
(2012). The interplay of the heavier and most energetic UHECR galactic nuclei
with the mainly local (Mpcs) extragalactic signals ruled by lightest nuclei,
seems to fit the main pieces of UHECR puzzle.
