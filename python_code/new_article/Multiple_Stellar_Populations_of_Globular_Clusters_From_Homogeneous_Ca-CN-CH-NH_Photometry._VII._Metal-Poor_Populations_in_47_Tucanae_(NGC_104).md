 We present new large field-of-view ($\sim$1\deg$\times$1\deg) Ca-CN
photometry of the prototypical metal-rich globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC
104). Our results are the following. (1) The populational number ratios of the
red giant branch (RGB) and red horizontal branch (RHB) are in excellent
agreement: n(CN-w):n(CN-s) = 30:70 ($\pm$1--2), where the CN-w and CN-s stand
for the CN-weak and CN-strong populations, respectively. Both the CN-s RGB and
RHB populations are more centrally concentrated than those of CN-w populations
are. (2) Our photometric metallicities of individual RGB stars in each
population can be well described by bimodal distributions with two metallicity
peaks, [Fe/H] $\sim$ $-$0.72 and $-$0.92 dex, where the metal-poor components
occupy $\sim$ 13% of the total RGB stars. The metal-poor populations are more
significantly centrally concentrated than the metal-rich populations, showing a
similar result that we found in M3. (3) The RGB bump $V$ magnitudes of
individual populations indicate that there is no difference in the helium
abundance between the two metal-poor populations, while the helium enhancement
of $\Delta Y$ $\sim$ 0.02--0.03 is required between the the two metal-rich
populations. (4) The RHB morphology of 47 Tuc appears to support our idea of
the bimodal metallicity distribution of the cluster. We suggest that 47 Tuc
could be another example of merger remnants of two globular clusters, similar
to M3 and M22.
