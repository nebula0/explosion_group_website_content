 I report the results of a new search for transiting planets on a set of 1.4
million lightcurves extracted from TESS Full Frame Images (FFIs) using the
DIAmante pipeline. The data come from the first two years of observations of
TESS (Sectors 1-26) and the study is focused on a sample of FGKM dwarf and
subgiant stars optimized for the search of transiting planets. The search was
performed on the detrended and stitched multi-sector lightcurves applying the
Box-fitting Least Squares algorithm and a Random Forest classifier. I present a
catalogue of 1160 transiting planet candidates, among which 842 are novel
discoveries. The median radius of the transiting bodies in the catalog is 6.8
R$_{\oplus}$. The radii range from 0.8 R$_{\oplus}$ to 27.3R$_{\oplus}$ while
the orbital periods range from 0.19 days to 197.2 days with a median of 3.6
days. Each candidate is accompained by a validation report and the
corresponding DIAmante lightcurve. The material is available at CDS, on the
ExoFOP website and on the DIAmante portal at MAST.
