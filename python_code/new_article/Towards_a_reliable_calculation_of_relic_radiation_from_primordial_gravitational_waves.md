 Inflationary gravitational waves, behaving as additional radiation in the
Early Universe, can increase the effective number of relativistic species
($N_{\rm eff}$) by a further correction that depends on the integrated
energy-density in gravitational waves over all scales. This effect is typically
used to constrain (blue-tilted) models of inflation in light of the bounds
resulting from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we recompute this
contribution, discussing some caveats of the state-of-the-art analyses. Through
a parametric investigation, we first demonstrate that the calculation is
dominated by the ultraviolet frequencies of the integral and therefore by the
behavior of the tensor spectrum on scales corresponding to modes that cross the
horizon very close to the end of inflation, when the slow-roll dynamics breaks
down and the production of gravitational waves becomes strongly model
dependent. Motivated by these results, we realize a theoretical Monte Carlo
and, working within the framework of the Effective Field Theory of inflation,
we investigate the observable predictions of a very broad class of models. For
each model, we solve a system of coupled differential equations whose solution
completely specifies the evolution of the spectrum up to the end of inflation.
We prove the calculation of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}^{\rm GW}$ to be remarkably
model-dependent and therefore conclude that accurate analyses are needed to
infer reliable information on the inflationary Universe.
