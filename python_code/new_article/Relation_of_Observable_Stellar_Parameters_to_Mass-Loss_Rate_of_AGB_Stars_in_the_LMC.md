 Using the Riebel et al. (2012) data set for 6,889 pulsating AGB stars in the
LMC, we have derived formulae for mass-loss rate as a function of luminosity
and pulsation period or luminosity and mass in three ways, for each of five
subsets of data: fundamental mode oxygen rich stars, first overtone mode oxygen
rich stars stars, fundamental mode carbon stars, first overtone mode carbon
stars, and extreme carbon stars. Using the distribution of the stars in period
versus luminosity and mass versus luminosity, we are able to derive a power-law
fit to the dependence of mass-loss rate on those quantities. This results in
formulae that reproduce observed mass-loss rates and are in general agreement
with the expectation from mass-loss models that the mass-loss rate is highly
sensitive to luminosity, mass, and pulsation period.
  In the process of carrying out this analysis we have found
radius-mass-luminosity and examined pulsation-mass-radius relations using
published evolutionary and pulsation models. These allow us to derive mass and
radius from the observed quantities luminosity and pulsation period. We also
derived new mass-loss rate versus color relations.
