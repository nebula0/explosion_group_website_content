 Observations of WASP-121 b have suggested an under-abundance of titanium and
titanium-oxide from its terminator region. In this study, we aim to determine
whether this depletion is global by investigating the day-side emission
spectrum. We analyse 8 epochs of high-resolution spectra obtained with the
ESPRESSO spectrograph at optical wavelengths, targeting orbital phases when the
day-side is in view. We use a cross-correlation method to search for various
atoms, TiO and VO and compare to models. We constrain the velocities and
phase-function of the emission signal using a Bayesian framework. We report
significant detections of Ca I, V I, Cr I, Fe I and Ni I, but not T i or TiO.
Models containing Ti are unable to reproduce the data. The detected signals are
consistent with the known orbital and systemic velocities and with peak
emission originating from the sub-stellar point. We find that Ti is depleted
from regions of the atmosphere where transmission and emission spectroscopy are
sensitive. Supported by recent HST observations that constrain the night-side
temperature, we interpret this as evidence for the night-side condensation of
titanium, preventing it from being mixed back into the upper layers of the
atmosphere elsewhere on the planet. Species with lower condensation
temperatures are unaffected, implying sharp chemical transitions exist between
ultra-hot Jupiters that have slight differences in temperature or dynamical
properties. As TiO can act as a strong source of stratospheric heating,
cold-trapping creates a coupling between the thermal structures on the day-side
and night-side, and thus condensation chemistry needs to be included in global
circulation models. Observed elemental abundances in hot Jupiters are not
reliably representative of bulk abundances unless night-side condensation is
accounted for or the planet is hot enough to avoid night-side cold-traps
entirely.
