 We define deriving semantic class targets as a novel multi-modal task. By
doing so, we aim to improve classification schemes in the physical sciences
which can be severely abstracted and obfuscating. We address this task for
upcoming radio astronomy surveys and present the derived semantic radio galaxy
morphology class targets.
