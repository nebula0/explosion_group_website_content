 We present results from an atmospheric retrieval analysis of Gl 229B using
the BREWSTER retrieval code. We find the best fit model to be cloud-free,
consistent with the T dwarf retrieval work of Line et al. 2017, Zalesky et al.
2022 and Gonzales et al. 2020. Fundamental parameters (mass, radius,
log(L_{Bol}/L_{Sun}), log(g)) determined from our model agree within 1\sigma to
SED-derived values except for T_{eff} where our retrieved T_{eff} is
approximately 100 K cooler than the evolutionary model-based SED value. We find
a retrieved mass of 50^{+12}_{-9} M_{Jup}, however, we also find that the
observables of Gl 229B can be explained by a cloud-free model with a prior on
mass at the dynamical value, 70 M_{Jup}. We are able to constrain abundances
for H_2O, CO, CH_4, NH_3, Na and K and find a supersolar C/O ratio as compared
to its primary, Gl 229A. We report an overall subsolar metallicity due to
atmospheric oxygen depletion but find a solar [C/H], which matches that of the
primary. We find that this work contributes to a growing trend in
retrieval-based studies, particularly for brown dwarfs, toward supersolar C/O
ratios and discuss the implications of this result on formation mechanisms,
internal physical processes as well as model biases.
