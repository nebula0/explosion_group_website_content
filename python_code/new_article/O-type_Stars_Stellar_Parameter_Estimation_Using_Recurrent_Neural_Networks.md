 In this paper, we present a deep learning system approach to estimating
luminosity, effective temperature, and surface gravity of O-type stars using
the optical region of the stellar spectra. In previous work, we compare a set
of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in order to establish a
reliable way to fit a stellar model using two methods: the classification of
the stellar spectra models and the estimation of the physical parameters in a
regression-type task. Here we present the process to estimate individual
physical parameters from an artificial neural network perspective with the
capacity to handle stellar spectra with a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), in
the $<$20 S/N boundaries. The development of three different recurrent neural
network systems, the training process using stellar spectra models, the test
over nine different observed stellar spectra, and the comparison with
estimations in previous works are presented. Additionally, characterization
methods for stellar spectra in order to reduce the dimensionality of the input
data for the system and optimize the computational resources are discussed.
