 Cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion is the result of the interaction of such charged
particles against magnetic fluctuations. These fluctuations originate from
large-scale turbulence cascading towards smaller spatial scales, decomposed
into three different modes, as described by $magneto-hydro-dynamics$ (MHD)
theory. As a consequence, the description of particle diffusion strongly
depends on the model describing the injected turbulence. Moreover, the amount
of energy assigned to each of the three modes is in general not equally
divided, which implies that diffusion properties might be different from one
region to another. Here, motivated by the detection of different MHD modes
inside the Cygnus-X star-forming region, we study the 3D transport of CRs
injected by two prominent sources within a two-zone model that represents the
distribution of the modes. Then, by convolving the propagated CR-distribution
with the neutral gas, we are able to explain the $\gamma$-ray diffuse emission
in the region, observed by the Fermi-LAT and HAWC Collaborations. Such a result
represents an important step in the long-standing problem of connecting the CR
observables with the micro-physics of particle transport.
