 We explore how finite integration time or temporal binning can affect the
analysis of exoplanet phase-curves. We provide analytical formulae to account
for this effect or, if neglected, to estimate the potential biases in the
retrieved parameters. As expected, due to their smoother variations over longer
time-scales, phase curves can be binned more heavily than transits without
causing severe biases. In the simplest case of a sinusoidal phase curve with
period $P$, the integration time $\Delta t$ reduces its amplitude by the
scaling factor $\text{sinc}{ \left ( \pi \Delta t / P \right ) }$, without
altering its phase or shape. We also provide formulae to predict reasonable
parameter error bars from phase-curve observations. Our findings are tested
with both synthetic and real datasets, including unmodelled astrophysical
signals and/or instrumental systematic effects. Tests with the Spitzer data
show that binning can affect the best-fitting parameters beyond predictions,
due to the correction of high-frequency correlated noise. Finally, we summarize
key guidelines for speeding up the analysis of exoplanet phase curves without
introducing significant biases in the retrieved parameters.
