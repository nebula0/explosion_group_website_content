 The Pierre Auger Observatory, being the largest air-shower experiment in the
world, offers an unprecedented exposure to neutral particles at the highest
energies. Since the start of data taking more than 18 years ago, various
searches for ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E\gtrsim10^{17}\,\text{eV}$) photons have
been performed: either for a diffuse flux of UHE photons, for point sources of
UHE photons or for UHE photons associated with transient events like
gravitational wave events. In the present paper, we summarize these searches
and review the current results obtained using the wealth of data collected by
the Pierre Auger Observatory.
