 GRB 221009A is a bright Gamma-ray burst (GRB) with isotropic energy being
larger than $10^{54} ~{\rm ergs}$. Its fairly low redshift makes it a promising
candidate for high energy neutrino detection. However, a neutrino search for
this GRB reported by the \emph{IceCube} collaboration yielded a null result. In
this paper, we utilize the upper limit from IceCube observation to test
different GRB prompt emission models. We find that, at least for this specific
burst, the dissipative photosphere model could be ruled out in a large
parameter space. The internal shock model can survive only with a large bulk
motion Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, where the most stringent and conservative
constraints are $\Gamma > \sim 400$ and $\Gamma > \sim 200$, respectively. For
the Internal-collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART)
model, the constraint from GRB 221009A is modest. Under ICMART model, only for
extreme situations when most dissipated energy deposit into protons and all
accelerated protons are suitable for producing neutrinos, a slightly large bulk
motion ($\Gamma > \sim 400$) is required.
