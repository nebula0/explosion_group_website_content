 HERMES (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites) is a space-borne
mission based on a constellation of nano-satellites flying in a low-Earth orbit
(LEO). The six 3U CubeSat buses host new miniaturized instruments hosting a
hybrid Silicon Drift Detector/GAGG:Ce scintillator photodetector system
sensitive to X-rays and gamma-rays. HERMES will probe the temporal emission of
bright high-energy transients such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), ensuring a fast
transient localization (with arcmin-level accuracy) in a field of view of
several steradians exploiting the triangulation technique. With a foreseen
launch date in late 2023, HERMES transient monitoring represents a keystone
capability to complement the next generation of gravitational wave experiments.
Moreover, the HERMES constellation will operate in conjunction with the Space
Industry Responsive Intelligent Thermal (SpIRIT) 6U CubeSat, to be launched in
early 2023. SpIRIT is an Australian-Italian mission for high-energy
astrophysics that will carry in a Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) an actively
cooled HERMES detector system payload. On behalf of the HERMES collaboration,
in this paper we will illustrate the HERMES and SpIRIT payload design,
integration and tests, highlighting the technical solutions adopted to allow a
wide-energy-band and sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray detector to be accommodated
in a 1U Cubesat volume.
