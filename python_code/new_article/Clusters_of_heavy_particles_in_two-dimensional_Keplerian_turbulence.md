 Protoplanetary disks are gaseous systems in Keplerian rotation around young
stars, known to be turbulent. They include a small fraction of dust from which
planets form. In the incremental scenario for planet growth, the formation of
kilometer-size objects (planetesimals) from pebbles is a major open question.
Clustering of particles is necessary for solids to undergo a local
gravitational collapse. To address this question, the dynamic of inertial
particles in turbulent flows with Keplerian rotation and shear is studied.
Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations are performed to explore
systematically two physical parameters: the rotation rate, which depends on the
distance to the star, and the particle response time, which relates to their
size. Shear is found to drastically affect the characteristics of the turbulent
flow destroying cyclones and favoring the survival of anticyclones. Faster
rotation enhances clustering of particles in anticyclones, especially for
intermediate particles sizes. These clusters form in a hierarchical manner and
merge together with time. For parameter values falling outside this regime,
solids still concentrate on fractal sets. The mass distribution of particles is
then found to be multifractal with small dimensions at large orders, intriguing
for triggering their gravitational collapse. Such results are promising for a
precise description and better understanding of planetesimal formation.
