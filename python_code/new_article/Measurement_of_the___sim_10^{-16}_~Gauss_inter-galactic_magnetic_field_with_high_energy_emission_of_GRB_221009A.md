 The fast evolving TeV-PeV transients and their delayed GeV-TeV cascade
emission in principle server as an ideal probe of the inter-galactic magnetic
fields which are hard to be measured by other methods. Very recently, LHASSO
has detected the very high energy emission of the extraordinary powerful GRB
221009A up to $\sim 18$ TeV within $\sim 2000$ s after the burst trigger. Here
we report the detection of a $\sim 400$ GeV photon, without accompanying
prominent $\gamma$ rays down to $\sim 2$ GeV, by Fermi-LAT in the direction of
GRB 221009A at about 0.4 days after the burst. Such a hard spectrum is
unexpected in the inverse Compton radiation of the electrons accelerated by the
external forward shock. Instead, the inverse Compton scattering of the $e^\pm$
pairs, produced from the cascade of the early primary $\sim 20$ TeV $\gamma$
rays, off the diffuse far-infrared and microwave backgrounds can generate
$\gamma$ rays up to $\sim 400$ GeV with a rather hard low energy spectrum. We
infer that an inter-galactic magnetic field strength of $B_{\rm IGMF}\sim
10^{-16}$ Gauss can naturally account for the arrival time of the $\sim 400$
GeV photon. Such a $B_{\rm IGMF}$ is comparable to the limits set by the
statistical studies of the high energy emission of TeV blazars.
