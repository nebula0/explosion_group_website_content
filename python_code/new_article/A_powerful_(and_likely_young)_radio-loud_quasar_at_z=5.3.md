 We present the discovery of PSO J191.05696$+$86.43172 (hereafter PSO
J191$+$86), a new powerful radio-loud quasar (QSO) in the early Universe (z =
5.32). We discovered it by cross-matching the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio
catalog at 1.4 GHz with the first data release of the Panoramic Survey
Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS PS1) in the optical. With a
NVSS flux density of 74.2 mJy, PSO J191$+$86 is one of the brightest radio QSO
discovered at z$\sim$5. The intensity of its radio emission is also confirmed
by the very high value of radio loudness (R>300). The observed radio spectrum
of PSO J191$+$86 shows a possible turnover around $\sim$1 GHz (i.e., $\sim$6
GHz in the rest frame), making it a Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) source.
However, variability could affect the real shape of the radio spectrum, since
the data in hand have been taken $\sim$25 years apart. By assuming a peak of
the observed radio spectrum between 1 and 2 GHz (i.e. $\sim$ 6 and 13 GHz in
the rest-frame) we found a linear size of the source of $\sim$10-30 pc and a
corresponding kinetic age of 150-460 yr. This would make PSO J191$+$86 a newly
born radio source. However, the large X-ray luminosity (5.3$\times$10$^{45}$
erg s$^{-1}$), the flat X-ray photon index ($\Gamma_X$=1.32) and the
optical-X-ray spectral index ($\tilde{\alpha_{ox}}$=1.329) are typical of
blazars. This could indicate that the non-thermal emission of PSO J191$+$86 is
Doppler boosted. Further radio observations (both on arcsec and parsec scales)
are necessary to better investigate the nature of this powerful radio QSO.
