 The brightest long gamma-ray burst detected so far by the Swift-BAT and
Fermi-GBM telescopes, GRB~221009A provides an unprecedented opportunity for
understanding the high-energy processes in extreme transient phenomena. We find
that the conventional leptonic models, synchrotron and
synchrotron-self-Compton, for the afterglow emission from this source is unable
to explain observation of $\gamma$ rays, by the LHAASO detector, extending up
to 18 TeV energies. We model $\gamma$-ray spectrum estimated in the energy
range 0.1-1 GeV, by the Fermi-LAT detector. The flux predicted by our leptonic
models is severely attenuated at $> 1$ TeV due to $\gamma\gamma$ pair
production with extragalactic background light, and hence an additional
component is required. Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays can be accelerated in the
GRB jet and their propagation induces an electromagnetic cascade in the
extragalactic medium. The line of sight component of this flux can explain TeV
emission detected by LHAASO, requiring a fraction of the GRB blastwave energy
in ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. This could be the first direct evidence of
ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray acceleration in GRBs.
