 NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission promises to
improve our understanding of hot Jupiters by providing an all-sky,
magnitude-limited sample of transiting hot Jupiters suitable for population
studies. Assembling such a sample requires confirming hundreds of planet
candidates with additional follow-up observations. Here, we present twenty hot
Jupiters that were detected using TESS data and confirmed to be planets through
photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging observations coordinated by the TESS
Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP). These twenty planets have orbital periods
shorter than 7 days and orbit relatively bright FGK stars ($10.9 < G < 13.0$).
Most of the planets are comparable in mass to Jupiter, although there are four
planets with masses less than that of Saturn. TOI-3976 b, the longest period
planet in our sample ($P = 6.6$ days), may be on a moderately eccentric orbit
($e = 0.18\pm0.06$), while observations of the other targets are consistent
with them being on circular orbits. We measured the projected stellar obliquity
of TOI-1937A b, a hot Jupiter on a 22.4 hour orbit with the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect, finding the planet's orbit to be well-aligned with the stellar spin
axis ($|\lambda| = 4.0\pm3.5^\circ$). We also investigated the possibility that
TOI-1937 is a member of the NGC 2516 open cluster, but ultimately found the
evidence for cluster membership to be ambiguous. These objects are part of a
larger effort to build a complete sample of hot Jupiters to be used for future
demographic and detailed characterization work.
