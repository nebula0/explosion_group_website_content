        As one of the major components of the interstellar medium, the ionized gas in our Milky Way, especially the low-density diffuse component, has not been extensively observed in the radio band. The Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey covers the sky area within the Galactic latitude of $\pm10^\circ$ around the Galactic plane visible by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), and the spectral line data are simultaneously recorded during the pulsar survey observations. With an integration time of 5 minutes for each beam, the GPPS survey project provides the most sensitive piggyback spectra for tens of radio recombination lines (RRLs) in the band of 1000$-$1500 MHz for H$nα$, He$nα$, C$nα$, as well as H$nβ$ and H$nγ$. We processed the spectral data of RRLs, and obtained a sensitive averaged H$nα$ RRL map of a sky area of 88 square degrees in the inner Galaxy of 33$^\circ$ $\leqslant l \leqslant$ 55$^\circ$ and $|b| \leqslant$ 2.0$^\circ$. The final spectral data of the H$nα$ RRLs have a spatial resolution of $\sim$3$^\prime$, a spectral resolution of 2.2 km s$^{-1}$, and a typical spectral rms noise of 0.25 mJy beam$^{-1}$ or 6.3 mK in main-beam brightness temperature. The new H$nα$ RRL map shows complex structural features dominated by a number of HII regions and large extended diffuse ionized gas regions. We detect about 94% of the known HII regions and confirm 43 WISE HII regions in the observed sky area. Several large HII regions or star-forming complexes in the distant outer Galaxy are resolved in the map of H$nα$ RRLs. Extended RRL features of the diffuse ionized gas are detected. The RRL data products of the GPPS survey will be published and updated at http://zmtt.bao.ac.cn/MilkyWayFAST/
